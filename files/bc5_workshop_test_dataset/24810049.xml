Here, we applied the yeast two-hybrid system to examine whether other proteins can interact with CD40. Fas-Associated Factor 1(FAF1) was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library using the CD40 cytoplasmic tail (216-278 aa) as a bait construct. FAF1 was able to interact with CD40 both in vitro and in vivo. The FAF1 N-terminal domain was sufficient to bind CD40 and required the TRAF6-binding domain within the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 for binding. CD40 ligation induced FAF1 expression in an NFkappaB-dependent manner. Knockdown of FAF1 prolonged CD40-induced NFkappaB, whereas overexpression of FAF1 suppressed CD40-induced NFkappaB activity and this required interaction of FAF1 with the CD40 receptor via its FID domain. Thus, we report a novel role for FAF1in regulating CD40-induced NFkappaB activation via a negative feedback loop. Loss of FAF1 function in certain human malignancies may contribute to oncogenesis through unchecked NFkappaB activation, and further understanding of this process may provide a biomarker of NFkappaB-targeted therapies for such malignancies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1356</offset><text>CD40, a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and its ligand (CD40L/CD154) have a central role in coordinating immune responses and can mediate antiviral and antitumour effects.1 CD40 is expressed in normal B cells and malignant haemopoietic cells. Although CD40 ligation induces the survival and proliferation of normal B cells and of low-grade B-cell malignancies, the activation of CD40 in Burkitt lymphoma cells results in growth inhibition and apoptosis.2, 3, 4 CD40 expression is also upregulated in a number of carcinomas. It is assumed that CD40 expression in the context of malignant epithelium confers a growth/survival advantage via signalling pathways such as NFkappaB and PI3Kinase/Akt and/or via modulation of antitumour immune responses, although its precise contribution to malignancy remains unclear. As CD40 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, signalling depends on the recruitment of adapter proteins known as TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) to mediate signal transduction initiated by CD40 ligation. Two domains in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 are critical for TRAF association and signal activation: a membrane-proximal region containing amino acids Gln234Glu235 responsible for TRAF6 binding and a Pro250XGln252XThr254 motif that is critical for interactions with TRAF2 and TRAF3 and indirectly with TRAF5.5, 6, 7 The ligand-dependent recruitment of these adaptor molecules triggers the activation of multiple signalling pathways, including the JNK, ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the transcription factors NFkappaB, STAT and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) cascade, which act in concert to regulate many of the pleiotropic activities of CD40 in a cell type-dependent manner.7, 8, 9 Previous studies have shown that stimulation of Hela cells expressing a CD40 mutant (CD40AmT6; the amino acids T254, Q234, E235 within the CD40 cytoplasmic tail were replaced by A residues), which does not bind TRAF2,3,5 and 6,6, 7, 10 induced robust ERK and JNK phosphorylation, detectable phosphorylation of p38 and significant IkappaBalpha degradation, suggesting that other signalling motifs within CD40 or other proteins may still be involved in CD40-induced signalling pathways. Therefore, identification of other proteins that directly interact with the CD40 receptor may provide better understanding of CD40-induced signalling pathways. In this study, we attempted to identify other CD40-interacting proteins by utilising the yeast two-hybrid analysis technique (YTH) using the CD40 cytoplasmic tail as the bait construct. Fas-Associated Factor 1 (FAF1) was isolated as a novel CD40-interacting partner, and we report a novel function for FAF1 regulation of CD40-induced NFkappaB.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4100</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4108</offset><text>Identification of FAF1 as a novel CD40 interactor by YTH analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4174</offset><text>Before screening the Hela cDNA library, the inability of CD40 to activate the transcription of the reporter markers was confirmed as EGY48 yeast cells harbouring the pEG202/LexA-CD40 bait construct were unable to grow on Glu/CM-H,L plate.

The inability of yeast cells harbouring either pEG202/LexA-CD40 or the pJG4-5/FAF1-HA.tag alone or the empty vectors to grow on the selective Gal-Raff/CM-H,W,L medium further indicates the specificity of CD40-FAF1 interaction in the two-hybrid system.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5654</offset><text>FAF1 interacts with the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 via its Fas-interacting domain</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5738</offset><text>To confirm CD40-FAF1 interaction in vitro and to determine which domain of CD40 was requisite for this, we investigated whether a series GST-CD40 fusions incorporating wild-type CD40 or mutants lacking specific TRAF-binding domains could pull down FAF1 protein in a GST pull-down assay. Thus, GST-CD40 fusions including wild-type CD40, CD40mT6 (which does not bind TRAF6), CD40A (which does not bind TRAF2/3) and CD40AmT6 (which does not bind any of TRAF6, TRAF2 or TRAF3) mutants were expressed and purified from E.coli BL21 bacterial cells for GST pull-down assays (Figure 2a). In addition, a GST-LMP1 fusion protein was used as a negative control as an LMP1 protein does not possess a TRAF6-binding domain; instead, TRAF6 is recruited to LMP1 indirectly via TRADD molecules in the LMP1-induced signalling complex.11 An overexpressed FAF1 protein from the pJG4-5/FAF1-HA.tag construct in yeast cells was specifically detected using an anti-HA specific antibody with GST-CD40wt and A mutant but not with the CD40mT6 or CD40AmT6 or the LMP1 control, indicating the requirement of the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 for its interaction with FAF1 (Figure 2b).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6896</offset><text>To determine which domain of FAF1 mediates its interaction with CD40, full-length FAF1 and truncated N-terminal domain, which contains the Fas-interacting domain (FID) required for FAF1-Fas interaction, (FAF1mt; 1-305aa) were cloned as HA-tagged fusions in pMCV/HA vectors (Figure 2c).

Cells were collected for protein lysate preparation and total RNA extraction for cDNA synthesis and subsequent RT-PCR reaction. FAF1 protein expression was upregulated following CD40 ligation in CD40-positive carcinomas but not in the CD40-negative Hela control (Figure 4b). Next RT-PCR was performed to quantify the level of FAF1 mRNA expression. FAF1 mRNA was upregulated following CD40 ligation in CD40-positive cells but not in CD40-negative cells in a time-dependent manner, confirming that FAF1 upregulation was due to increased transcription rather than protein stabilisation (Figure 4c).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8989</offset><text>As CD40 ligation activates the transcription factor, NFkappaB, we investigated whether CD40-induced FAF1 expression is regulated by NFkappaB.

FAF1 upregulation was suppressed in cells pretreated with the NFkappaB inhibitor (Figures 4d and e). To ensure that SC514 was functioning specifically through NFkappaB inhibition and not through interference with other CD40-induced signalling molecules, total IkappaBalpha, P-AKT, P-ERK and P-JNK were examined by western blot analysis.

CD40-induced NFkappaB activation was significantly reduced when FAF1 was co-expressed with CD40 in an FAF1 concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5a). To confirm that this effect was not due to FAF1 overexpression negatively affecting the concomitant expression of CD40, the level of CD40 expression in the presence or absence of FAF1 was examined by western blotting using anti-CD40 and GFP specific antibodies for detection of CD40 and GFP-FAF1 fusions.

However, as we have shown here that FAF1 interacts with CD40 and that this interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 and the N-terminal FID domain of FAF1, we postulated that FAF1 regulation of CD40-induced NFkappaB activation may be via an alternative mechanism requiring this interaction, perhaps through competition with TRAF6 for occupancy of this binding site on the CD40 receptor. If this were the case, then it would be anticipated that the CD40-binding FID domain of FAF1 would be sufficient to inhibit CD40-induced NFkappaB even in the absence of the active C-terminal domain of FAF1. This was investigated by examining the effect of truncated FAF1 (FAF1mt: 1-305 aa) compared with full-length FAF1 on CD40-induced NFkappaB activation.

Although expression of FAF1mt resulted in modest inhibition of TNFalpha-induced NFkappaB activation, inhibition was more profound with full-length FAF1, suggesting that, unlike CD40, FAF1-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced NFkappaB activation requires the full-length protein with its C-terminal ubiquitin-related functions (Figure 6b).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13631</offset><text>FAF1 regulates TRAF6-mediated CD40 signalling through competition for CD40 receptor binding</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13723</offset><text>Activation of NFkappaB by CD40 is, to a large extent, dependent upon TRAF6 binding to the CD40 receptor upon its ligation.

Blotting of total cell lysates indicated that this reduction was not due to an effect of TRAF6 transfection on the level of HA-FAF1 expression as cells transfected with CD40, HA-FAF1 and TRAF6 satisfactorily expressed all three proteins (Figure 7, lower panel). As TRAF6 and FAF1 do not directly interact with each other, these data suggest that FAF1 and TRAF6 are competing for the TRAF6-binding site of CD40.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>15122</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15133</offset><text>Although the interaction between CD40 and members of the TRAF family is well characterised, this is the first study to show an interaction between CD40 and Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1). FAF1 was first identified as a partner of the Fas receptor using yeast two-hybrid analysis13 and has recently been reported as a component of the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) in Fas-mediated apoptosis.14 Although structurally FAF1 does not contain any typical death motifs such as a death domain (DD), death effector domain (DED) or caspase recruitment domain, FAF1 overexpression can initiate apoptosis in the absence of any extrinsic death signals.15 FAF1 is a 74-kDa protein with an N-terminal domain that mediates its interaction with Fas, the Fas-interacting domain (FID), and a functional ubiquitin-like C-terminal domain that is required for its pro-apoptotic activity. FAF1 is also involved in the ubiquitination pathway and interacts with ubiquitin and valosin-containing protein, a multiubiquitin chain-targeting factor, stabilising the protein, which may activate survival pathways including Akt and NFkappaB.16 In addition, FAF1 inhibits the chaperone activities of the heat-shock proteins Hsc70 and Hsp70.17</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16351</offset><text>Here we report for the first time the finding that FAF1 is also a novel interactor with the CD40 receptor. We further demonstrate that the CD40-FAF1interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain in CD40 and the FID of FAF1, as CD40 mutants lacking the TRAF6-binding domain failed to bind to FAF1, although the N-terminal domain of FAF1 (FAF1mt; 1-305aa) was sufficient to bind to CD40 in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16777</offset><text>Although in the yeast two-hybrid experiments CD40 could not pull down full-length FAF1, this may be attributable to the high proteolytic activity associated with protein purification in yeast. Indeed, a 40-kDa degradation product of FAF1 has been found in various human cell lines.18 Moreover, 40-kDa FAF1 fragments (spanning 1-313 and 1-315 aa) have been identified with ectopic expression of recombinant FAF1 in Escherichia coli (E-coli).19 In addition, it is possible that steric hindrance caused by the large GST tag (26 kDa) to the FAF1-binding site within the relatively small CD40 cytoplasmic domain (6.3 kDa) might prevent interaction of the full-length FAF1 protein with CD40 but allow smaller fragments that contain the crucial CD40-binding site to bind. In support of this, HA-tagged FAF1 fusions, including the full-length FAF1 (FAF1wt) and its N-terminal domain (FAF1mt; 1-305 aa), were co-immunoprecipitated and detected with CD40 in the in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17784</offset><text>An additional novel finding reported here is that FAF1 is upregulated in response to CD40 ligation and this is a result of transcriptional activity as increased levels of FAF1 mRNA were also detected. Furthermore, this appears to be mediated by CD40-induced NFkappaB activation, as inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the upregulation of FAF1. This is of particular interest as FAF1 has been reported to inhibit NFkappaB activation by various stimuli including TNFalpha.12 In agreement with this, here we report that CD40-induced NFkappaB activation was inhibited by ectopic expression of FAF1 in HEK293 cells and that more prolonged activation of NFkappaB by CD40 ligation was observed following FAF1 knockdown. Thus, as FAF1 expression is induced by CD40-mediated NFkappaB activation and as FAF1 then suppresses CD40-induced NFkappaB, we postulate a regulatory role for FAF1 in CD40-induced NFkappaB signalling via a negative feedback loop. This is further supported by the kinetics of NFkappaB and FAF1 activation in response to CD40 ligation with a rapid, yet transient induction of NFkappaB followed temporally by increased FAF1 expression and then rapid downregulation of NFkappaB.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18931</offset><text>FAF1 is reported to regulate TNF-induced NFkappaB activity via direct interaction with RelA, preventing its translocation to the nucleus or through interaction with IKKbeta to suppress IKK activity or by binding to and blocking the protein kinase CK2.12, 20, 21, 22 Functional CK2 is a key NFkappaB regulator that can phosphorylates IkappaB and activate the IKKalpha kinase, leading to NFkappaB activation.23, 24, 25 However, here we report a novel mechanism by which FAF1 regulates NFkappaB induced by CD40 ligation. We have demonstrated for the first time that FAF1 interacts directly with CD40 via the TRAF6-binding domain of the receptor. As TRAF6 binding in response to CD40 ligation is, at least in part, responsible for CD40-mediated NFkappaB activation, we propose that FAF1 regulates NFkappaB in the context of CD40 signalling through competition with TRAF6 for its CD40-binding domain (Figure 7). Thus, CD40 ligation recruits TRAF6 to the receptor, which, in turn, stimulates NFkappaB activation. Among other things, this results in transcriptional activation of the FAF1 gene and the increased FAF1 protein then competes with, and displaces, TRAF6 from the CD40 receptor, thus terminating NFkappaB activation via a negative feedback loop (Figure 8). This is supported by our observation that a truncated FAF1, lacking the functional C-terminal domain but retaining the capacity to bind to CD40, is still able to inhibit CD40-induced NFkappaB activation. Indeed, NFkappaB inhibition was more pronounced with the mutant compared with wtFAF1 perhaps due to the stoichiometry of the shorter mutant protein allowing it to access the TRAF6-binding site of the CD40 receptor more readily (Figure 6a).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20598</offset><text>As well as having an important homeostatic role in regulating CD40 signalling, it is likely that aberrant FAF1 function has a pathological role in cancer. For example, it has been reported that FAF1 function is downregulated in mantle cell lymphoma,26 gastric cancer27 and mesothelioma.28 Thus, loss of regulatory function of FAF1 may permit constitutive NFkappaB signalling, which then contributes to the malignant phenotype. Perturbation of FAF1 function may therefore serve as a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to therapeutic inhibition of NFkappaB-dependent cancers. Further studies to characterise loss of FAF1 in solid tumours, particularly those associated with CD40 expression and their potential sensitivity to NFkappaB inhibition, are warranted and are currently underway in our laboratory.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>21395</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21417</offset><text>Maintenance of cell lines</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21443</offset><text>Bladder carcinoma EJ cells, gastric carcinoma AGS cells, cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, Hela cells stably expressing wild-type CD40 and embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in either RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% FCS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21701</offset><text>Plasmids</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21710</offset><text>A cDNA encoding wild-type CD40 cytoplasmic tail (216-278 aa) was amplified by PCR (Table 1) from the pCDNA3.1/CD40 construct and cloned into the LexA-based pEG202 yeast two-hybrid plasmid between EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites.

The final isolated positive clones were identified by sequencing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>24743</offset><text>GST pull-down, immunoprecipitation and western blotting</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24799</offset><text>For preparation of protein extract from yeast cells, EGY48 cells transformed with the isolated pJG4-5/HeLa cDNA clone coding the FAF1 sequence obtained from 5 ml overnight cultures grown in Glu/CM-W medium were switched into Gal-Raff/CM-W for at least 8 h with vigorous shaking for induction of HA-FAF1 protein fusion under the GAL1 promoter. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 1ml of GST pull-down lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mug/ml leupeptin and 1 mug/ml aprotinin). An equal volume of acid washed glass beads (Sigma UK) was added and vortexed for 60 s then immediately placed on ice for 1 min, 8-10 times. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was assessed. For preparation of GST-CD40 fusion protein (Figure 2a) extract, E.coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pGEX-5X-1/CD40 constructs and grown up to an OD600 ~0.4 before supplementing the bacterial culture with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.1 mM for 5 h. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 1 ml of GST pull-down lysis buffer and lysed on ice by pulse sonication. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 13 000 r.p.m. at 4 oC for 15 min. Soluble GST-CD40 proteins were purified by incubating overnight at 4  C with lysis buffer-prewashed GST Sephrose 4B beads (Amersham, Amersham, UK). Sepharose bead/GST-CD40 complexes were obtained by centrifugation at 3000 r.p.m. at 4 oC for 5 min. Following three washes with lysis buffer; the resultant Sepharose bead/GST-CD40 complexes were resuspened in a volume of lysis buffer to obtain 1:4 slurry. For the GST pull-down, 1 mg of precleared total yeast protein lysate was incubated with 20 mul of Sepharose/GST-CD40 beads for 2 h at 4  C. The GST-CD40-FAF1 bead complexes were pelletted down by slow-spin centrifugation (3000 r.p.m., 5 min, 4 oC) then washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The GST-CD40-FAF1 bead complexes were resuspended in 50 mul 2 x concentrated GSB buffer and boiled for 5 min. Thirty microlitres of the total volume of the samples was examined by western blot analysis for HA-FAF1 fusion protein using an anti-HA antibody, and the remaining volumes were immunoblotted for GST fusion proteins using an anti-GST antibody.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27245</offset><text>For the co-immunoprecepitation studies, 293 cells co-transfected with 2 mug empty pcDNA and pMCV/HA-FAF1wt or empty pcDNA3.1 and pMCV/HA-FAF1mt mutant or pcDNA/CD40 and pMCV/HA-FAF1wt, or pcDNA3.1/CD40 and pMCV/HA-FAF1mt mutant were lysed in situ with co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% Brij-98/PBS, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 5 mug/ml leupeptin, 1 mug/ml aprotinin, and 1 mug/ml pepstatin), allowed to lyse on ice for 20 min and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 13 000 r.p.m. at 4 oC. One milligram of total protein/ml co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer was precleared for 1 h at 4 oC with 30 mul Protein G sepharose beads (Amersham) (1:1 slurry, prewashed in co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer). CD40 immunocomplexes were then prepared by incubating the pre-cleared lysate with 4 mug mouse monoclonal anti-CD40 antibody (MABTECH) overnight at 4oC then precipitated by incubating for 2 h at 4 oC with 20 mul protein G-Sepharose beads prewashed three times in co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. The CD40-sepharose bead complexes were subjected to slow-spin centrifugation (3000 r.p.m., 5 min at 4 oC) and then washed three times with 1 ml co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer using slow-spin centrifugation to pellet the beads.

In the absence of CD40 ligand, the conformation of the CD40 receptor favours FAF1 binding. In this conformation, TRAF6 is not bound to the receptor and is therefore degraded resulting in low NFkappaB activity. In the early stage of CD40 ligation, receptor trimerisation promotes recruitment of TRAF6. This results in NFkappaB induction, which, in turn, upregulates FAF1 expression. Higher FAF1 protein levels result in NFkappaB inhibition by direct inhibition of the assembly of the IKK complex and, indirectly, by competing with the CD40-TRAF6 binding through the TRAF6-binding domain</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table_title_caption</infon><offset>42726</offset><text>Oligonucleotides used in this study</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table</infon><offset>42762</offset><text>   Name Primer (5'-3') Restriction sites Construct Application   CD40EcoR-F GAATTCAAAAAGGTGGCCAAGAAG EcoR1 pEG202/CD40 Yeast two hybrid  CD40Xho-R CTCGAGTCACTGTCTCTCCTGC Xho1 pEG202/CD40 Yeast two hybrid  FAFXho-F1 CTCGAGTGGCGTCCAACATGGA C Xho1 pEGFPC1/FAF1wt&amp;mt Protein expression  FAFEcoR-R915 CTTAAGTTAATCCACCCCAAATTCTGTAG C EcoR1 pEGFPC1/FAF1mt Protein expression  FAFEcoR-R1953 CTTAAGTTACTCTTTTGCTTCAAGGAAAAGG EcoR1 pEGFPC1/FAF1wt Protein expression  GAPDHF244 CCTCCAAAATCAAGTGGGGCG NA NA RT-PCR  GAPDHR845 ACCACCAGGTGCTCAGTGTAG NA NA RT-PCR  FAF1F GCCACCAAT TATGGGAGG G NA NA RT-PCR  FAF1R CAG ATC CCA AGC CCA GGT NA NA RT-PCR</text></passage></document></collection>
