Specific to virus detection, cell surface or endosome-associated TLRs recognize viral DNA or RNA and initiate MyD88 or Trif-dependent signaling cascades that activate transcription factors NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and, ultimately, turn on the transcription of hundreds of cellular genes, of which type I interferons (IFNs) are best known for their antiviral effects. In addition, RNA helicase RIG-I or MDA5 can detect intracellular viral double-stranded RNA and activate NF-kappaB and IRFs via the adaptor protein MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/Cardif, a CARD domain containing protein that is anchored to the mitochondrial membrane [4], [5], [6], [7]. Interestingly, viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) have evolved mechanism to interfere with the critical innate signaling pathways, allowing escape from the host immune surveillance [5], [8], [9], [10].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2724</offset><text>Ubiquitin is a 76-amino-acid globular protein that is nearly identical throughout eukaryotes [11]. Ubiquitylation, the process of conjugating ubiquitins to other proteins, plays a pivotal role in the physiological turnover or the degradation of proteins in response to environmental stimuli. Historically, ubiquitylation of a protein is known to target it to 26S proteasome for degradation. It is increasingly realized that ubiquitylation also plays a unique role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways [12]. For example, the transcription factor NF-kappaB is normally held in cytoplasm in association with its inhibitor called I-kappaB. Upon cell stimulation with interleukin -1 (IL-1) or TLR ligands, I-kappaB is phosphorylated by an I-kappaB kinase (IKK) complex [12]. The phosphorylation of I-kappaB triggers its K48-linked polyubiquitylation and its subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, which then releases NF-kappaB for activation [12].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3666</offset><text>Although multiple studies revealed the involvement of ubiquitylation and de-ubiquitylation in regulating IL-1R/TLR pathways, only one recent report by Chuang and Ulevitch described that the ubiquitin-mediated receptor degradation negatively regulated TLR signaling [13]. In that study, a novel TLR interacting protein termed Triad 3A was demonstrated to be an E3 ligase which interacts with several TLRs. Triad3A induces ubiquitylation of TLR9 and TLR4 but not TLR2, which then targets them for proteasomal degradation. As a result of this, the TLR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB was suppressed. Most recently, it is shown that Triad3A promoted down-regulation of two TIR domain-containing adapter proteins, TIRAP and Trif, RIP1 which is the essential downstream protein of TNF-alpha signaling [14], as well as TRAF3 which mediates the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway [15]. Thus, ubiquitylation and degradation of innate signaling molecules by Triad3A represents a novel pathway by which the host limits the intensity and duration of innate signaling pathways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4720</offset><text>In a yeast two-hybrid screening study, we identified an ubiquitin-like protein PLIC-1 as a potential interacting partner of the TIR domain-containing proteins. Using luciferase reporter assays, we found that PLIC-1potently suppressed the TLR3-Trif-dependent IFN-beta promoter activity while exerted minimal effect on TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB activation or TLR7- or MAVS-dependent IFN-beta promoter activity. When endogenous PLIC-1 was reduced by short-hairpin based interfering RNA (shRNA), new castle diseases virus (NDV) became hypersensitive to poly I:C treatment, reinforcing the idea that PLIC-1 negatively regulates TLR3-pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) studies revealed that PLIC-1 coprecipitated with Trif, but not TLR3. A GST-pull down further showed that the ubiquitin associated (Uba) domain of PLIC-1 directly pulled down Trif. Subsequent confocal microscopy revealed that PLIC-1 co-localized both with Trif and LC3, an autophagosome marker, in punctate structures within the cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of PLIC-1 decreased the cellular abundance of Trif via a pathway that can be blocked by Nocodazole, but not MG132. Altogether, these data suggest that PLIC-1 is a novel inhibitor of TLR3-Trif signaling pathway by decreasing the abundance of the innate signaling adaptor molecule Trif via the autophagic pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6059</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6067</offset><text>Identification of PLIC-1 as a TIR-interacting protein</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6121</offset><text>To screen for novel regulators of TLR-pathway, we conducted a yeast-two hybrid assay using the Clontech Matchmaker III system (Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

PLIC-1 is known to bind to membrane proteins including presenilins and GABA receptors [16], [17]. PLIC-1 was reported to bind ubiquitylated proteins and ubiquitin ligases such as E6AP and betaTRCP, and proteasome subunits [18]. These interactions are thought to interfere with normal targeting of proteins for proteasome-dependent-degradation, resulting in enhanced stability potential affecting the signaling pathways in which these proteins are involved.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7281</offset><text>PLIC-1 exerted a strong inhibitory effect on Trif-dependent signaling in reporter assays</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7370</offset><text>We first investigated the role of PLIC-1 in regulating TLR4 signaling using luciferase reporter assays. To our surprise, overexpression of PLIC-1 had no effect on TLR4-dependent NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1A), while modestly suppressed the activation of an ISG promoter driven luciferase reporter by a constitutive TLR4 activator, CD4-TLR4 [19] (Fig. 1B). We then sought to explore its effect on other TLR signalings. To this end, we performed a series of reporter assays and found that PLIC-1 is a potent inhibitor of TLR3-Trif-pathway. First, overexpression of PLIC-1 inhibited the Trif-dependent activation of NF-kappaB-dependent reporter (Fig. 1C) as well as p125-Luc whose transcription is under the control of IFN-beta promoter [20] (Fig. 1D), but had negligible effect on the basal transcription of the reporter gene (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that this inhibition was associated with a specific tagged PLIC-1, YFP- or flag-tagged PLIC-1 constructs were included in the transfection and similar dose-dependent inhibition was observed (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Of note, expression of PLIC-1 in 293T cells did not inhibit the activation of p125-Luc by overexpressing IRF-3, suggesting that PLIC-1 exerts its inhibitory effect at a step that is upstream of IRF-3 (Fig. 1F). To investigate whether PLIC-1 exerts effects on other innate immune signaling, similar studies were repeated on HEK-TLR7 stable cell line and cells transfected with MAVS. It was observed that PLIC-1 failed to have any effect in either case (Fig. 1G&amp;H). Thus, the inhibitory effect of PLIC-1 appeared to be limited to Trif signaling. Because Trif is absolutely required in TLR3 pathway whose activation increases transcription of IFN-beta gene [21], we assessed the effect of PLIC-1 on TLR3 activation. In mouse macrophage cells J774A.1 that were stimulated with poly I:C (TLR3 ligand), the activation of IFN-beta-driven luciferase decreased as the amount of PLIC-1 increased (Fig. 1I). Together, these data suggest that PLIC-1 negatively modulates the TLR3-Trif pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>9432</offset><text>Overexpression of PLIC-1 inhibited TLR3 signaling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9483</offset><text>A.

The shRNA harboring a scrambled sequence and the one targeting mouse PLIC-1(LMP) were included as controls for specificity. To monitor the knockdown effect, shRNA vectors were first transfected along with HA-hPLIC-1 construct in 293T cells. Two shRNA constructs targeting to human PLIC-1 specifically suppressed the expression of HA-hPLIC-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The shRNA construct (#1602) was subsequently employed to reduce the endogenous PLIC-1 (Fig. 2B) and this led to enhanced activation of Trif-dependent IFN-beta promoter activity (Fig. 2C). Moreover, transfection with this construct enhanced the activation of the IFN-beta-promoter activity (p125-Luc) upon poly I:C stimulation (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results reinforced the finding that PLIC-1 inhibits the TLR3/Trif-mediated innate immune signaling activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>12370</offset><text>Reduction of PLIC-1 level enhanced TLR3-Trif-mediated signaling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12435</offset><text>A.

Because NDV is highly sensitive to type I interferon treatment, such a system allows rapid and sensitive monitoring of bioactivity of type I interferon. Shown in Fig. 3, polyI:C stimulation of A549 cells modestly reduced the NDV-GFP infection, while the inhibition was significantly enhanced in PLIC-1 knockdown cells.

A recent study, however, indicated both PLIC-1 and 2 associate with autophagosomes and depletion of PLICs inhibited autophagosome degradation during nutrient starvation [24]. Trif was found in some speckle-like structures in the cytosol and did not co-localize with TLR3, but transiently associated with TLR3 upon polyI:C stimulation in the same speckle-like structures [25]. Overexpressed Trif reportedly multimerizes and localizes to punctate cytoplasmic structures referred to as the Trif &quot;signalosome&quot; [23], [24]. To investigate the subcellular distribution pattern of PLIC-1 and Trif, YFP-PLIC-1 and Flag-Trif were transfected into human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5.1 cells and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Huh7.5.1 cells were chosen for this part of the study because they produce very little TLR3 and Trif at endogenous level and have a relatively large volume of cytoplasm [26], which makes them ideal for imaging cytoplasmic proteins. To avoid potential artifact due to overexpression, we intentionally kept the amount of DNA plasmid very low in this study. It was found that YFP-PLIC-1 was concentrated into punctate ring-like structures (Fig. 5A), similar to what has been reported [24], [27]. Immunostaining revealed a rather punctate subcellular distribution pattern for Flag-Trif alone, which is also consistent with previous reports [25], [28]. Of note, we observed a pronounced co-localization of YFP-PLIC-1 and Flag-Trif in punctate cellular structures (Fig. 5B). Of note, GFP itself did not co-localize with Flag-Trif (Fig. 5C). By contrast, there was no co-localization of PLIC-1 and MAVS at all (Fig. 5D). Attempts to image ectopically expressed TLR3 in Huh7.5.1 cells were not successful due to the extremely low level of expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>18441</offset><text>PLIC-1 co-localized with Trif.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>18472</offset><text>The human hepatoma cells Huh7.5.1, were seeded on glass cover slip and then transfected with 0.1 microg of YFP-PLIC-1 alone (A) or with 0.1 microg Flag-Trif (B) in a 24-well plate format. 24 hours post-infection, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-Flag M2 antibody.

Unchecked signaling activation, however, can lead to excessive production of inflammatory mediators that cause tissue damages. Studies in recent years have now revealed a number of negative regulators of innate immune signaling pathways, such as IL-1R-associated kinase M (IRAK-M) [30], CYLD [31], SIGIRR [32], suppression of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) [33], etc. Most recently, Triad3A was demonstrated to act as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and enhance ubiquitylation and proteolytic degradation of several TLRs and RIP1, resulting in the attenuation of TLR signalings [13], [14]. The identification of PLIC-1 now adds a new member to this long list of negative regulators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22849</offset><text>PLIC-1 is a type 2 ubiquitin-like (ubl) proteins. In contract to the small-sized type 1 ubl proteins that are covalently linked to target proteins in a fashion similar to ubiquitin, type 2 ubl proteins are not ligated to other proteins and their functions are poorly defined. There are four members of PLIC in mouse and human [18]. Data from functional analyses suggest a role for PLICs in the in vivo degradation of several proteins known to be ubiquitylation-dependent substrates of the proteasome [18], [34], [35]. Interestingly, in transfection studies, PLICs either inhibit or promote ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation [16], [18], [36]. Moreover, inhibition of G protein signaling by PLIC-1 is independent of proteasome activity [37]. Like ubiquitin, the expression of PLICs is ubiquitous in almost all cell types [17], [31]. Particularly interesting, it is recently shown that PLIC-1 and 2 locate to autophagosomes [23].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23785</offset><text>Despite that our study initially identified PLIC-1 as a TLR4 interacting partner, we failed to observe any noticeable effect of PLIC-1 on TLR4-dependent NF-kappaB activation in reporter assays. It must be pointed out, however, that TLR4 signals through MyD88 and Trif sequentially [38] to activate a second-phase signaling. LPS stimulation first triggers TLR4-MyD88-depdent signaling from plasma membrane and activates NF-kappaB; endocytosis of TLR4 then quenches MyD88-dependent signaling and starts a second phase of TRIF-dependent signaling from endosomes [38]. Because the latter event was more obvious in dendritic cells (DCs) and bone marrow derived macrophages, which were not employed in this study, the observed modest inhibition of PLIC-1 on TLR4-dependent ISG promoter activity could be more pronounced should DCs be examined. Nonetheless, we found that PLIC-1 inhibited the TLR3-Trif-dependent signaling both in reporter assays as well as during NDV infection. TLR3 detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is a common intermediate during virus replication, and signals exclusively via the adaptor protein Trif. The cell biology of TLR3 and Trif has been very interesting because TLR3 reportedly localizes to endosomes or phagolysosomes [39], [40], [41], [42]. Trif, however, does not co-localize with TLR3 at resting state, but transiently associates with TLR3 upon ligand engagement and initiates the signaling [24]. The exact location of intracellular Trif remains mysterious as immunostaining of Trif did not co-localize with any known early or late endosomal marker [25], [27]. Our finding that Trif co-localized with PLIC-1 and LC3 raises an interesting possibility that Trif may localize to autophagosome. Interestingly, results from the GST pull-down assay demonstrated that the Uba domain of PLIC-1 interacts with Trif, and this is also the domain that is reportedly required for PLIC-1 to target to autophagosomes [24]. Remarkably, ample evidence now highlights a connection between TLR-mediated innate immunity and autophagy. For instance, LPS increased autophagosomes and autophagy-mediated cell death of infected macrophages [43]. In addition, autophagy was shown to be essential for TLR7-mediated recognition of RNA viruses [43]. In future, it will be interesting to determine whether co-localization of Trif and PLIC-1 occurs constitutively or upon TLR3 activation. This likely requires imaging both proteins at endogenous level in cells or near endogenous level in a stable cell line that expresses tagged proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26325</offset><text>In our study, expression of PLIC-1 diminished the level of Trif when expressed from a transfected plasmid, suggesting PLIC-1 may accelerate the degradation of Trif. Cellular proteins can be degraded via two pathways: the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is fundamental to protein degradation [44]. In brief, ubiquitin is initially activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme known as enzyme-1 (E1), and then transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Together with the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), E2 covalently attaches ubiquitins to the target protein at the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. The polyubiquitin chain finally signals 26S proteasome to degrade the ubiquitylated proteins. The ubiquitin-like PLIC-1, however, has no enzymatic activity and is not known to be covalently linked to any protein. The autophagic pathway, on the other hand, offers an alternative mechanism to proteasomes for the degradation of cytoplasmic contents [45], [46]. In this case, portions of cytoplasm and cell organelles are first taken into phagosomes that fuse with lysosomes into phagolysosomes in which proteins will be finally degraded by lysosomal enzymes [47]. Since both PLIC-1 and Trif can localize to autophagosomes and the PLIC-1-dependent effect on Trif is sensitive to Nocodazole treatment, it is tempting to envision that cells may utilize the authophagic pathway that typically degrades cellular components during starvation to degrade Trif signalosome and hence terminate the Trif-dependent innate signaling. Future work is warranted to explore this novel mechanism in detail.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27991</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28013</offset><text>Cell Lines and reagents</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28037</offset><text>293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cell line and the human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5.1 (gift from Dr. F.

Then media containing plasmids and media containing lipofectamine were then mixed together, allowed to sit for 15-20 minutes at room temperature, and added slowly to the well. After 4 hours the media was replaced with fresh media containing 5% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% NEAA, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection in J774 macrophage cell line, macrophages were transfected according to AFCS (Alliance for Cellular Signaling gateway) protocol of Transfection of Raw Cells. 1x105 cells were plated in each well the day before transfection in 24-well plates. For each transfection, 1 microl Lipofectamine 2000 was added to 25 microl Opti-MEM in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. In another tube the required amount of plasmid was added, mixed, and allowed to sit for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 25 microl DNA mixtures was added to the 25 microl Lipofectamine 2000 mixture and mixed by pipetting.

The resulting blots were blocked in 10% milk for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 C. The secondary antibody used in the immunoblot was a 1:2000 dilution of HRP-linked anti-IgG, followed by detection using the ECL reagents (Amersham). For immunoprecipitation-coupled western blotting, a quantity of 50-100 microg of total soluble extract was incubated with an appropriate amount of beads conjugated with the specified Ab for 2 h at 4 C.
