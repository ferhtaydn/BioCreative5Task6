Its overexpression leads to excessive inactivation of tumor protein p53, diminishing its tumor suppressor function. HDM2 also affects the cell cycle, apoptosis and tumorigenesis through interacting with other molecules, including several ribosomal proteins. To identify novel HDM2 regulators, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using HDM2 as bait. Among the candidates, ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) was characterized as a novel HDM2-interactor. The interaction between HDM2 and RPL26 was further validated by in vivo and in vitro assays. RPL26 modulates the HDM2-p53 interaction by forming a ternary complex among RPL26, HDM2 and p53, which stabilize p53 through inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2. The ribosomal stress caused by a low dose of Act D enhances RPL26-HDM2 interaction and activates p53. Overexpression of RPL26 results in activating of p53, inhibits cell proliferation and induces a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. These results provide a novel regulatory mechanism of RPL26 to activate p53 by inhibiting HDM2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1178</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1191</offset><text>Tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that acts by stopping cell cycle progression or promoting apoptosis when cells encounter stress stimuli such as oncogene activation or DNA damage (1). The importance of p53 in cancer development is illustrated by the fact that p53 is highly mutated in many different cancers (2) and is probably rendered inactive by a range of indirect mechanisms (for example, HDM2 amplification or loss of ARF) in most other cancer types.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1662</offset><text>Having a short half-life, p53 is normally maintained at low levels in unstressed mammalian cells by continuous ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. This is primarily due to the interaction of p53 with the RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 (also known as HDM2; 3). The mdm2 gene is one of the target genes the transcription of which is activated by the p53 proteins, thus forming a tight auto-regulatory feedback loop (4,5).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2117</offset><text>The ability of HDM2 to keep p53 in check is essential for normal cell function. The repression operates via three mechanisms. First, HDM2 interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53, which is the primary binding site for HDM2. Through binding to p53 at its transactivation domain, HDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity (4). Second, HDM2 labels p53 with ubiquitin for degradation (6). Lastly, HDM2 is responsible for the export of p53 from nucleus to cytoplasm to abrogate its transcriptional activity (7). Many cellular stresses such as DNA damage stabilize p53 protein by blocking the HDM2-p53 feedback loop (8). One prominent example is that, in response to oncogene activation, p14ARF activates p53 by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2 and relieving HDM2-dependent inhibition of p53 (9).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2946</offset><text>Besides ARF, a number of factors that alter the p53-HDM2 feedback loop have been identified, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Nucleolar proteins are also prominent among this group, including the ribosomal proteins L5, L11, L23, S7 (10-14), PML (15) and nucleophosmin (also called B23). Ribosomal proteins L5, L11, L23 and S7 interacted with HDM2 and inhibited the HDM2-p53 feedback loop in response to ribosomal stress, such as treatment with low dose actinomycin D (Act D), serum starvation (13), 5-fluorouracil (16) and mycophenolic acid treatment (17). Thus, releasing small protein molecules such as the ribosomal proteins from the nucleolus leads to p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3712</offset><text>In this study, we designed to search for novel HDM2-binding proteins. We conducted stringent yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using full-length HDM2 to screen human liver cDNA library. RPL26 was a novel ribosomal protein that can directly interact with HDM2, and its interaction with HDM2 was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, RPL26 modulates the HDM2-p53 interaction by forming a ternary complex among RPL26, HDM2 and p53, which leads to the stabilization of p53 and HDM2 by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2. RPL26 activates p53 by overcoming HDM2-mediated p53 degradation through the proteasome. The interaction of RPL26 and HDM2 was increased and activated p53. Overexpression of RPL26 results in activating of p53, inhibits cell proliferation and induces a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. From previous report, RPL26 was found to bind to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA and control p53 translation and induction after DNA damage (18). Thus, RPL26 is the only identified ribosomal protein that activates p53 by simultaneously potentiating its translation and attenuating its degradation till now. These observations provide an additional regulatory mechanism associated with RPL26 in regulating p53 function.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4967</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4989</offset><text>Cell culture</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5002</offset><text>Human embryonic kidney HEK293, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, mouse p53-/-/mdm2-/- MEF cells and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum, and Human lung small cell adenocarcinoma H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% FBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5333</offset><text>Plasmids and reagents</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5355</offset><text>The pCMV-p53, pCMV-HDM2, and pcDNA3/poly-HA-tagged ubiquitin were kindly provided by Dr Y.

A total of ~1 x 106 independent transformants were analyzed and clones were selected for positive interactions based on screening for expression of reporter genes His3, LacZ and URA3. To eliminate interactions that originated from nonspecific promoter activation, we only considered DB-HDM2-AD-Prey pairs if they activated at least two out of three reporter genes. Positives were subsequently retested in fresh yeast cells, and their AD-Prey identities were determined with interaction sequence tags (ISTs) obtained by sequencing.

Wild-type and mutant RPL26 were overexpressed in MEF (p53-/-/mdm2-/-) cells with or without HDM2 in the presence of p53, and the target proteins in whole-cell lysates were detected by immunoblotting. (F) RPL26 modulates the HDM2-p53 interaction by forming a ternary complex among RPL26, HDM2 and p53. HEK293 cells were transfected with combinations of plasmids as indicated.

HDM2-dependent suppression of p53 may be related with its E3 ligase activity on p53 (6). To determine whether RPL26 stabilize p53 by affecting HDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, we did an in vivo ubiquitination assay. Overexpression of RPL26 not only led to marked inhibition of p53 ubiquitination (Figure 4A, lane 4 and 5) but also stabilized HDM2 (Figure 4B, lane 4 and 5). The ability of RPL26 to inhibit HDM2-induced p53 degradation could be explained by its inhibiting of HDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24055</offset><text>To further determine if RPL26 acts on HDM2 and p53 at the post-translational level, plasmids expressing HDM2, GFP and RPL26 were co-expressed in U2OS cells as indicated, which were then exposed to the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, for different times (Figure 4C). The p53 protein did not show apparent difference in RPL26 transfected cells. The level of p53 protein decreased when transfected with HDM2, but it can be rescued by the expression of RPL26. Compared to the control, the degradation of HDM2 protein was much more slowly in RPL26 transfected cells. The results suggest that RPL26 affect HDM2 and p53 at the post-translational level. The RPL26 might inhibit HDM2's E3 ligase function, while HDM2 harbors a self- and p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (6).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24844</offset><text>Furthermore, the binding of RPL26 and HDM2 seems to be crucial for this process.

But RPL26 mutants retaining the capacity for binding to HDM2 (B, C and E) stabilized p53 and HDM2, while those without binding capacity, A and D, did not increase the p53 and HDM2 levels in MEF (p53-/-/mdm2-/-) cells which were co-transfected with HDM2 (Figure 4E, right panels).

Previous report suggest that RPL26 may bind to 5'UTR of p53 mRNA and control p53 translation and induction after DNA damage (18). In this study, we identify that RPL26 regulate p53 protein level by physical interacting with HDM2. Unlike reported HDM2 interactors, RPL26 is the first ribosomal proteins that can regulate p53 activity at both translational and post-translational level.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32895</offset><text>As far as we know, several ribosomal proteins L5, L11, L23 and S7 have been shown to regulate p53 activity via binding to HDM2 and blocking HDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation (10-14). Further studies suggest that ribosomal proteins that can bind to HDM2 may regulate HDM2-p53 pathway in a cooperative way by forming a ribosomal proteins-HDM2-p53 complex (10,22). Our data demonstrated that RPL26 also can interact with HDM2 and form a complex with HDM2-p53 (Figures 1 and 4F), but further studies will be needed to illustrate the interrelationship of RPL26 and other ribosomal proteins in regulating p53 activity. Although these ribosomal proteins can block HDM2-p53 loop in response to ribosomal stress, the expression level of them changed in a different way in response to stress, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or low dose Act D treatment (13,16). We also detected the RPL26 expression level in response to low-dose Act D treatment (Figure 5), and it changed differently from other ribosomal proteins. The expression level of RPL26 by Act D is dosage dependent. It was decreased sharply after treatment of U2OS cells with 50 nM Act D. But the expression level of RPL26 by a low dose of Act D is not timely dependent. While the change of p53 level is not only effected by the dose of Act D but also the working time of low dose of Act D. These data suggest that exist of different mechanisms in regulating free ribosomal proteins response to perturbation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34379</offset><text>Moreover, our data show that the HDM2 protein level increased in U2OS cells when RPL26 overexpressed (Figure 4C). It suggests that the increase of HDM2 is related to the decreasing of HDM2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, not to the p53 transactivation of hdm2 gene. This phenomenon must be induced by the interaction of RPL26's binding to the central region of HDM2 which contains nuclear localization, export sequences and a zinc-finger domain. In the context of cancer-associated mutations in the HDM2 zinc-finger domain disrupt ribosomal protein interaction and attenuate HDM2-induced p53 degradation (23), ribosomal proteins' binding to HDM2 is an important mechanism in regulating p53.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35076</offset><text>RPL26 induces p53 through direct binding to HDM2 and decreasing HDM2's ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. This mode is different from the previous reported mechanism that RPL26 enhances p53 mRNA's translation and expression level. But both mechanisms could improve p53's level and activity and involve the middle domain of RPL26 which can bind to HDM2 and 5'UTR of p53 mRNA (18). This suggests that the two mechanisms might operate together in regulating p53 by RPL26. Recently, HDM2 has been reported to attenuate the association of RPL26 with p53 mRNA and repress RPL26-mediated augmentation of p53 protein synthesis by promoting RPL26's proteasome-mediated degradation and binding of RPL26 (24). Together, the interaction of RPL26 and HDM2 seems to have mutual action that adjusts HDM2 and RPL26's effecting on p53's expression level and activity. These suggest that RPL26 and p53 may competitively bind to HDM2. In this regard, the cancer-associated mutations in RPL26 gene that inhibit its interaction with 5'UTR of p53 mRNA or HDM2 are strong evidence of RPL26's importance in cancer. Moreover, previous study identified mutations in RPL26 in two murine tumor cell lines resulting in a unique tumor-associated antigen and a more aggressive tumor phenotype (25). Therefore, RPL26 might be a tumor suppressor that works by regulation HDM2-p53 loop.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36444</offset><text>To sum up, we establish that RPL26 has the capacity to stabilize p53 by binding to HDM2. Different from other HDM2 binding ribosomal proteins, RPL26 is the only identified ribosomal protein that can activate p53 by simultaneously potentiating its translation and attenuating its degradation till now. It would be important to further investigate the roles of RPL26 in p53-related cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36832</offset><text>FUNDING</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36840</offset><text>National High-tec Research Developing Programme (2006AA02A310); Special Funds for Major State Basic Research of China (2006CB910802); Chinese National Natural Science Foundation Projects (Innovation group project) (30621063).
