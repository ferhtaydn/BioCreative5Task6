The MACS epitope tagged protein isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to precipitate candidate partner proteins via the HA epitope. Eluted protein samples were split (1/3 and 2/3), size-fractionated in parallel on two polyacrylamide SDS-gels (concentration adjusted to protein size), electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and subjected to antibody detection. HA-tagged (1/3 aliquot) partner proteins were identified using an anti-HA horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (clone 3F10; Roche 2012819). The co-precipitated 6× his-tagged STM protein was visualized by a primary penta-His mouse antibody [α-(H)5; Qiagen 34660] and secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-mouse IGG (Dianova 115-035-062). Peroxidase activity was detected non-radioactively via chemiluminescence (ECL PLUS kit; Amersham Biosciences) and documented on Kodak-X-omat AR films. Epidermal proteins after bombardement of leek epidermal cells were isolated in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton and size-fractionated by SDS–PAGE. GFP fusion proteins were detected after transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP HRP-conjugated antibody (IgG1; Milteny Biotec 130-091-833).

As a potential transcription factor, STM was expected to direct GFP fluorescence into the plant cell nucleus. However, both fusion proteins, GFP-STM and STM-GFP remained in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B and C).
0663
The cytoplasmic retention of the chimeric GFP-STM protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of nuclei with propidium iodide. The comparison of a median Z-stack projection through the nucleus either analysed for GFP-STM fluorescence (Figure 1F), the corresponding propidium iodine stains (Figure 1G) and their overlay in Figure 1H confirm exclusion of GFP fluorescence from the nuclear compartment.
0007
In addition to the interactions in yeast, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope-tagged full-length proteins. The HA-tagged BLH proteins shown in Figure 2B were used to co-precipitate epitope-tagged STM-His (Figure 2C). The detection of the STM-His protein was strictly dependent on the presence of BLH partner proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments therefore confirm that the full-length STM protein interacts with full-length ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 proteins in vitro and substantiate the affinity of BLH/STM interactions.

The binding mode observed for Fc and the CgE portion of gE-gI in the gE-gI/Fc crystal structure was verified by an independent theoretical prediction of the CgE interaction with Fc. The gE-gI/Fc model resulting from prediction and crystallographic methods is consistent with biochemical data characterizing the interaction, provides insight into the molecular basis for the observed pH dependence of the gE-gI/Fc interaction, and allows mapping of CgE residues important for IgG binding and cell-to-cell spread. In addition, the orientation of the gE-gI/IgG complex on a membrane, as predicted from the complex crystal structure, demonstrates that antibody bipolar bridging can occur on the surface of an infected cell or virus.
0071
Various forms of gE and the gE-gI heterodimer were subcloned, expressed, and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cell supernatants by nickel affinity and/or IgG affinity and gel-filtration chromatography as described previously [12]. Two recombinant forms of the Fc fragment of IgG1, wtFc and heterodimeric Fc, which contain two and one gE-gI binding sites, respectively, were also produced in CHO cells and purified as described previously [12].
0114
Crystallization trials were conducted for various forms of CgE, gE, and gE-gI (including CgE [residues 213–390], gE [residues 21–419], gE2 [residues 21–390], gE-gI [gE plus gI residues 21–266], gE2-gI2A [gE2 plus gI residues 21–208], and gE2-gI2B [gE2 plus gI residues 21–201]) both alone and complexed with wtFc or heterodimeric Fc. The only isolated protein to crystallize was CgE (described above), and the only complex of the six possible gE-gI/Fc complexes that crystallized was one that contained gE residues 21–419 and gI residues 21–266 and wtFc (residues 223–447). The complex crystals grew from drops containing a 2:1 molar ratio of gE-gI and wtFc mixed with an equal volume of well solution (0.1 M MES [pH 6.0] or 0.1 M HEPES [pH 7.0] and 0.9–1.1 M sodium malonate), resulting in a final pH of approximately 7.5. Microseeding increased the reproducibility of crystal growth.

Guided by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer at 1.44 Å resolution, designed a mutation that disrupts homodimerization, and solved the X-ray crystal structure at 1.78 Å resolution of a Munc13–1 fragment bearing this mutation bound to the RIM2α ZF domain.
0114
The structural information available on protein–protein interactions involving ZF domains is also limited [25]. The X-ray structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α heterodimer described here provides the first high-resolution view of a complex directly involving a member from the family of ZF domains that includes α-RIMs and other Rab effectors. The structure shows that two surfaces at opposite sides of the RIM2α ZF domain interact with two different structural motifs of Munc13–13–150. Thus, the N-terminal loop region of the RIM2α ZF domain binds to the tip of the C2A-domain β-sandwich, whereas the crevice formed by the C-terminal β-hairpin and helix a2 binds the C-terminal helix of Munc13–13–150. Interestingly, in the complex between the α subunit of Hif-1 (Hif-1α) and the TAZ1 domain of CREB-binding protein (a ZF domain unrelated to the RIM2α ZF domain), Hif-1α also wraps around the TAZ1 domain, interacting with surfaces at opposite sides of the domain [31]. An emerging theme from these observations is that, because of their small size, ZF domains may often use multiple surfaces to increase the affinity and specificity of interactions with target proteins, although further research will be necessary to assess the generality of this notion.

Mutagenesis of residue R1161 (in α2AA and α2AAKYA, removing another conserved charged residue) to alanine significantly reduced α2 tail association with Rab21 judged by yeast mating tests and immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, F1159A mutation (α2AARA, possibly creating a conformational change) showed reduced association in the yeast assays, whereas in immunoprecipitations the reduction was not significant. These data on the mutant integrins suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain and residue R1161 of α2-integrin are important for the Rab21 association.

(A) Nontransfected MDA-MB-231 cells were surface labeled with cleavable biotin and lysed immediately or allowed to internalize cell surface proteins for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed as indicated, and the Rab coprecipitating proteins were detected first with anti-biotin antibody followed by stripping and reprobing with anti–β1-integrin antibody. The quantification shows the amount of coprecipitated biotinylated protein relative to total precipitated integrin (means ± range; n = 2).
0029
In density gradient fractionations, expression of GFP-Rab21 shifted the integrins toward the denser Rab-positive fractions (Hughes et al., 2002), and GFP-Rab21 cofractionated with α2-integrin in fractions 3–9 (Fig. 3 D). A further shift in the endogenous integrin pool (to fractions 5–11) was observed upon expression of GFP-Rab21GTP, and GFP-Rab21GDP was also observed in the denser fractions (Fig. 3 D). In the lighter fractions (3–5), GFP-Rab21 and integrin were found to cosediment with the Golgi-marker GM130, whereas in the denser fractions, cosedimentation was observed with the ER marker P115 (fractions 6–8) and EEA1 (fractions 7–9; Fig. S3 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1). This data, together with the abundance of integrin vesicles observed in Rab21-expressing cells (Fig. 2), suggests that Rab21 targets integrins to the endocytic fraction in human cells.

The effect of depleting RCK/p54 on localization of Ago2 was next examined by immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells expressing Myc-Ago2 and siRNAs against RCK/p54. As shown in Figure 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G, depleting RCK/p54 disrupted the cellular P-body structures. In these P-body-deficient cells, Ago2 proteins were diffused throughout the cytoplasm and no longer accumulated at specific foci (Figure 4A and 4E). This cytoplasmic redistribution of Ago2 suggests that its localization to P-bodies is driven in mammalian cells by factors such as RCK/p54.
0416
We next visualized Lsm1 and Ago2 by immunofluorescence using antibodies against Lsm1 and Myc tag and found that Lsm1 and Ago2 co-localized in P-bodies (Figure 5B). To determine the status of P-body structures and RISC localization in cells after Lsm1 knockdown, Lsm1-depleted cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. We found that P-body structures were drastically disrupted, Ago2 was diffused throughout the cytoplasm, and Lsm1 and Ago2 were minimally co-localized (Figure 5B). These results show that P-body structures were drastically disrupted and Ago2 was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm when Lsm1 was depleted by RNAi.
0004
To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent (Figure 1A).
0019
Ago1 and RCK/p54 immunoprecipitated with Ago2 after RNase A treatment of HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that these proteins directly interact with Ago2. Interestingly, RCK/p54, Ago1, and Ago2 were also identified as a component of active RISC programmed with siRNA or miRNA and purified by biotin affinity to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Figures 2 and 3). We examined the P-body localization of Ago2 with Lsm1 and RCK/p54 by co-expressing YFP-tagged Lsm1 and RCK/p54 with CFP-Ago2. Interestingly, overexpressing YFP-RCK/p54 in HeLa cells increased the number of P-bodies (from ∼ 8 to ∼ 20 foci/cell). The number of P-bodies containing CFP-Ago2 also increased (Figure 1B). These results suggested a functional relationship between RCK/p54-Ago interactions and their localization to P-bodies.
0007
To examine the RNA dependence of protein–protein interactions, TCEs (250 μg) were treated before immunoprecipitation with 0.2 μg/ul of RNase A for 20 min at room temperature. Myc-tagged proteins were precipitated by incubating overnight with polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc antibodies directly conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, California, United States).
0004
(A) Affinity-purified miRISCs associated with PCK/p54 retain cleavage activity. To purify miRISC associated with RCK/p54, magnetic protein A beads coupled with rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-Ago2, or rabbit anti-RCK/p54 antibodies were incubated with HeLa cytoplasmic extracts. After immunoprecipitation, RISC activities were analyzed by incubating the supernatant (S) or bead (B) phases with 182-nt 32P-cap-labeled let-7 substrate mRNAs having a perfectly complementary or mismatched sequence to the let-7 miRNA. Cleavage products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. CE, cytoplasmic extract; PM, perfect match; MM, mismatch.
0019
(C) RCK/p54 interacts with Myc-Ago2 in Lsm1-depleted cells. HeLa cells were transfected for 48 h with Myc-Ago2 and control siRNA or siRNA against Lsm1, TCEs were prepared, and Myc-Ago2 was immunoprecipitated from an aliquot of TCE.
0006
In a converse experiment, ephrin-B1 was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cx43 antibody (Figure 6Cb).
0096
In our pull-down assay, wild-type ephrin-B1 interacted preferentially with phosphorylated Cx43 whereas ephrin-B1ΔPDZ interacted preferentially with unphosphorylated Cx43, suggesting that the interaction between ephrin-B1 and Cx43 might not be direct, and that these proteins might interact differently when at the cell surface or in the cytoplasm.
0006
Cells were lysed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.2% NP-40, and complete protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were resolved by standard Laemmli's SDS-PAGE (pH 8.8) unless otherwise stated. For immunoprecipitations: rat Bim antibody (Oncogene, San Diego, California, United States) was coated to goat-anti-rat immunoglobulin-agarose; rabbit Puma antibody was coated to protein A-sepharose; mouse NHE-1 antibody was coated to protein G-sepharose; rabbit Bcl-xL antibody was coated to goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-agarose. Lysates were precleared with the appropriate agarose.

(A) Bim binds to the native (Asn-Asn) but not deamidated forms of Bcl-xL. Wild-type (C57BL/6) thymocytes (1.5 × 107) were exposed to 5 Gy irradiation (IR) and then maintained in culture for the times shown, after which cells were lysed and either separated as whole cell lysates (WCL) or as Bim immunoprecipitates, followed by immunoblotting for either Bcl-xL or for Bim. Bim migrates as “extra-long” (EL) or “long” (L) forms.
0007
To probe for a possible signaling complex including the β1AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged β1AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag. A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the β1AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (Figure 1A).
0096
To assess which of the PDE4 subtypes contribute to the activity recovered in the β1AR IP, cardiomyocytes deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D were subjected to pull-down experiments.
0014
Importantly, upon stimulation with the adenylyl cyclase activator, Forskolin, all PDE4D isoforms show the same increase in activity in both cell types (Figure 5C), suggesting that loss of one βAR subtype or the other has not perturbed overall cAMP signaling. It also demonstrates that the spatial dimension of cAMP signaling is lost when generalized adenylyl cyclase activation is induced with Forskolin.
0096
In pull-down experiments using purified proteins (Figure 3D and E), β1AR efficiently interacts with PDE4D, whereas β2AR has negligible affinity for PDE4D, underscoring the direct mode of PDE4D–β1AR interaction versus the indirect, β-arrestin-dependent mode of PDE4D–β2AR interaction.

(B, C) Detergent extracts from neonatal cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated with PAN-selective antibodies for the PDE4 subtypes, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D (B), or with splice variant-selective anti-PDE4D antibodies (C).
0007
(A, B) Co-IP of exogenous β1AR and Myc-tagged PDE4D splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells. The efficiency with which β1AR pulls down the different PDE4D splice variants is quantified in (B). (C) Shown is the co-IP of exogenous β1AR and PDE4D8-Myc from extracts of MEFs derived from mice deficient in β-arrestin 1 and 2 (βarr1/2KO) or from wild-type controls (WT-MEF). (D, E) PDE4D3, and Flag-tagged receptors, β1AR and β2AR, were affinity purified after baculovirus expression (see Supplementary Figure 1). Purified PDE and (βARs) were then combined and the βARs immunoprecipitated.
0007
(A, B) Neonatal cardiac myocytes expressing a Flag-tagged β1AR were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine before cell lysis and IP with M1 (α-Flag) resin. The effect of a 5 min pre-treatment with 10 μM of the PDE4-specific inhibitor, Rolipram, or the PDE3-selective inhibitor, Cilostamide, on PKA-phosphorylation of the β1AR is detected in IBs using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (C, D) MEFs derived from mice deficient in PDE4D or wild-type controls were infected with adenovirus to express a Flag-tagged β1AR construct. At 40 h post-infection, cells were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine (NorEpi) before cell lysis and IP with M1 (α-Flag) resin. PKA-phosphorylation of the β1AR is detected in IB using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (E, F) Neonatal cardiac myocytes coexpressing a Flag-tagged β1AR and either GFP, a catalytically inactive PDE4D8 construct (PDE4D-DN; see also Supplementary Figure 5), or a catalytically inactive PDE3A1 (PDE3A1-DN) were subjected to α-Flag(M1)-IP, and the phosphorylation of the β1AR was subsequently detected in IB using a PKA-substrate-specific antibody.
0019
It remains to be determined to what extent PDE4D9, which is activated after both β1AR and β2AR stimulation (Figure 5) and which also showed interaction with β1AR in co-IPs of exogenous proteins (Figure 3A and B), can substitute for interaction with the βARs in vivo.
0017
The greater binding affinity of AIRE–PHD1 for H3K4me0 peptides was confirmed by both tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), yielding dissociation constants of ∼4 μM, ∼20 μM and >0.5 mM for H3K4me0, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively (supplementary Fig S2C online; Table 1).
0096
In agreement with the GST fusion pull-down experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy showed no binding of H3K4me0 to AIRE–PHD1 containing the APECED-causing C311Y mutation (Bjorses et al, 2000). Nevertheless, a second pathological mutant, V301M (Soderbergh et al, 2000), was still able to bind to H3K4me0, indicating that this mutation is not located in the H3 interaction site (Table 1).

0017
Indeed, fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC assays showed that the alanine mutations R2A in the H3 peptide and D312A in AIRE–PHD1 markedly reduced the binding affinity (Table 1; Fig 4C) without affecting the protein fold (supplementary Fig S3 online).
0096
Similarly, pull-down experiments with whole histones and the H3K4me0 peptide, together with fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC measurements performed on AIRE–PHD1-D297A showed reduced binding (Table 1; Fig 4).

Next, we studied in vivo histone binding by protein chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and observed that AIRE is found in complexes with a small fraction of histone H3 but not with H3K4me3. By contrast, binding of ING2, used as a positive control, was detected for both H3 and H3K4me3 (supplementary Fig S7 online). By using DNA ChIP analysis, we found that AIRE interacts with the insulin, involucrin and S100A8 promoter regions, but much less with the S100A10 and GAPDH promoters (Fig 5B).

(B) DNA ChIP analysis with anti-AIRE and IgG was performed from the stably transfected cells, as indicated. The fold differences are normalized to input fractions and shown in comparison with the background level (=1) with each primer set in each condition. The data are the averages of two independent experiments. AIRE, autoimmune regulator; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PHD, plant homeodomain.

To identify the mechanism of Plx1 recruitment to chromatin, we tested the interaction of Plx1 with the Mcm complex. We found that Plx1 co-precipitated with Mcm7 and that its binding was enhanced by activation of the checkpoint induced by pApT (Figure 5C).
0096
(D) Pull-down with GST–Polo box and MALDI-TOF analysis. Interphase extracts were incubated with GST–agarose beads or agarose beads with GST fused to the Polo box derived from human Plk1. After pull-down, proteins were consecutively eluted using 3 mg/ml of phosphopeptide solution (first elution=E1, second elution=E2, see Supplementary data for the sequence of the peptide and the Polo box) and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. Band 1 corresponds to Mcm2, band 2 to Mcm6, band 3 to Mcm4 and band 4 to Mcm7. The GST fusion protein containing the Polo box from Plk1 is shown at the bottom. (E) GST–Polo box pull-down of nuclear proteins probed with anti-Mcm7 antibodies (GST–Polo box). The extract used for the pull-down was supplemented with nuclei and buffer (Buff), 2.5 μM aphidicolin (APH) or 2.5 μM aphidicolin and 5 mM caffeine (Caff), as indicated. The total amount of unbound Mcm7 extracted from nuclei was loaded as a control (Input).
0096
To confirm this and to identify the AC-D-binding region in p62, we performed a GST pull-down assay using hTFIIEα AC-D and GST-fused p62 deletion mutants (Figure 2A). After purification by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography, all samples containing the C-terminal region, namely full-length GST–p621−548, GST–p62109−548, GST–p62238−548 and GST–p62333−548, were considerably degraded or incompletely translated (data not shown).

0096
Finally, the interaction of Vav3 and ERα was assessed by GST pull-down analysis.
0276
The proteins in the supernatant were subjected for SDS-PAGE, which was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.
0276
The samples were fractionated in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue.
0019
(A) Bax (100 nM) and/or tBid (20 nm) were incubated with 100 nM Bcl-XL (left panel) or 20 nM Bcl-XL (right panels) and liposomes. Samples were immunoprecipitated (IP) in either 2% CHAPS or 0.2% NP-40, as indicated, using an antibody with the indicated specificity and immunoblotted (IB) for the indicated protein.
0019
(B–D) Mutations prevent the binding of Bcl-XL to tBid, Bax, or both. (B and D) Bcl-XL (20 nM), or the indicated Bcl-XL mutants, (C) Bcl-XL Y101K or (D) Bcl-XL ΔBH4, were incubated with (C and D) 20 nM tBid or (B) tBid-mt1 with or without Bax (100 nM) and with liposomes. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (A).
0030
To determine whether the Bcl-XL/Bax heterodimer also prevented the subsequent oligomerization of Bax, we examined oligomerization by cross-linking. In these experiments, the cross-linker was added to reactions containing an equal amount of membrane-bound Bax in the absence or presence of Bcl-XL (Figure S3). In these reactions, membrane-bound Bcl-XL inhibited Bax oligomerization, as detected by cross-linking concomitant with inhibition of dye release from liposomes. Taken together, these results suggest that, when bound to Bcl-XL, Bax function is neutralized, both in recruitment of other Bax molecules through autoactivation and in oligomerization to permeabilize membranes (Figure 6C, step 6).
0019
(B) Bax was incubated in the presence of liposomes, tBid, and increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (A) without the addition of 2% CHAPS.
0019
(C) Bax was incubated for 2 h with liposomes (without tBid) at increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL or Bcl-XL Y101K. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (B).
0030
(D and E) Bcl-XL inhibits liposome-induced cross-linking of Bax. (D) Bax (100 nM) was incubated with liposomes for 2 h either alone (left panel), with 20 nM tBid (middle panel), or with 20 nM tBid and 100 nM Bcl-XL (right panel). Cross-linking with DSS was performed for 30 min at room temperature with or without 2% CHAPS to solubilize the liposomes prior to cross-linking, as indicated. Results were analyzed by immunoblotting. (E) Bax (100 nM) was incubated with or without liposomes for 2 h. Cross-linking and immunoblotting were performed as in (D).
0019
(F) Membrane-bound Bcl-XL inhibits the liposome-induced Bax conformational change with 50 μM m1Bid but not with 50 μM Bak BH3 peptide. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (B).
0030
To investigate further the effects of the membrane surface on Bax and the inhibition of these effects by Bcl-XL, cross-linking experiments using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were performed. Cross-linking of Bax into higher-order structures after Bax binds to membranes has been observed previously [18].
0030
Nevertheless, incubation with liposomes did result in the cross-linking of Bax into higher-order complexes (Figure 5D, left panel). As expected from previous results [7,9], the interactions between Bax monomers induced by incubation with membranes were not resistant to detergent solubilization prior to cross-linking. The Bax–Bax cross-links were reduced in the absence of liposomes (Figure 5E), suggesting that, similar to binding by the 6A7 antibody, they result from a liposome-induced conformational change in Bax. Addition of tBid to Bax and liposomes resulted in a similar cross-linking pattern, but these Bax oligomers were resistant to solubilization of the membrane with detergent (Figure 5D, middle panel). Membrane-bound Bcl-XL not only prevented the formation of detergent-resistant Bax cross-links but also prevented the cross-linking of Bax that resulted when Bax contacted the membrane surface (Figure 5D, right panel).

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the C-terminal calponin homology domain (CHC) of α-parvin at 1.05 Å resolution and show that it is able to bind all the LD motifs, with some selectivity for LD1, LD2, and LD4.
0114
We present the first high-resolution crystal structure of α-parvin-CHC and show that it interacts with all five paxillin LD motifs in solution. Three cocrystal structures of α-parvin-CHC with 20-residue peptides representing LD1, LD2, and LD4 allow us to characterize the interaction at atomic resolution and to highlight binding-induced conformational changes in α-parvin-CHC.
0114
To elucidate the molecular basis for LD recognition by α-parvin-CHC, we cocrystallized α-parvin-CHC with peptides representing the high-affinity ligands LD1, LD2, and LD4. The corresponding structures at 2.1 Å, 1.8 Å, and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively, were solved by molecular replacement with the α-parvin-CHC apo structure (Table 1).
0096
In contrast, previous data based on less-sensitive pull-down experiments suggested that α-parvin binding is limited to LD1 and LD4 (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000).
0077
Data were recorded on home-built or Bruker spectrometers with 11.7, 14.1, 17.6, and 22.3 T field strengths and processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995). Backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained using standard triple resonance experiments. Peptide titration experiments were performed by mixing two stock solutions (in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% D2O, and 30 μM DSS [pH 6.9]) containing 235 μM 15N-enriched α-parvin-CHC and either no or a maximum concentration of LD peptide at the required protein/ligand ratios (Figure S2). Phase-sensitive gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Kay et al., 1992) were recorded at 25°C.

To determine whether Ctk1 regulates the disposition of basal transcription factors, ChIP experiments on three constitutively expressed genes (PMA1, ADH1, and PYK1) were performed as described previously (Kim et al, 2004a). ChIP analysis using polyclonal antibodies against TBP (TATA-binding protein), TFIIB (Sua7), TFIIE (Tfa2) and TFIIH (Tfb1 and Kin28) generally confirmed the localization of these basal transcription factors at promoter regions in a wild-type (WT) background.

Consistent with this, when ChIP was carried out using strains deleted for the other subunits of the Ctk1 complex, including Ctk2 (cyclin subunit) or Ctk3 (accessory factor), TBP occupancy was again increased in the coding region of PMA1 (Supplementary Figure S1).

To exclude the possibility that the abnormal cross-linking of basal transcription factors in ctk1Δ cells was due to issues with the specific antibodies, the experiment was repeated with strains carrying TAP-tagged Tfg1, Tfg2, or Tfg3 (all subunits of TFIIF). ChIP was carried out with IgG-agarose as described previously (Kim et al, 2004a). Again, spreading of TFIIF from the promoter throughout the transcribed region was seen in ctk1Δ cells (Figure 2, Tfg1–TAP result shown is representative). Some promoter preference was still seen, but the qualitative difference upon Ctk1 deletion was clear.

A second model that could explain the cross-linking of basal factors throughout a gene is that they fail to release from RNApII as it moves into productive elongation. To test whether the extended pattern of basal factor cross-linking was completely coincident with RNApII, ChIP experiments were carried out at the termination site for PMA1 (Figure 3). RNApII levels decreased between primer sets 7 and 9 in WT and ctk1Δ strains, indicative of transcription termination in both backgrounds (Ahn et al, 2004; Kim et al, 2004b). TBP and TFIIH (Kin28) decrease in parallel with RNApII in ctk1Δ cells (Figure 3A), supporting the idea that these basal transcription factors travel with elongating RNApII.

ChIP analysis for TBP was performed in these strains to see whether aberrant cross-linking was observed. As serine 2 phosphorylation is known to be required for cotranscriptional 3′-end processing (Ahn et al, 2004), we also tested for the polyadenylation factor Rna14 as a positive control (Figure 4B). In accordance with our previous report, Rna14 cross-linking at the 3′-end of PMA1 was reduced to about one-third of WT levels.

As in vitro experiments with mammalian Cdk9 (Wada et al, 1998; Chao and Price, 2001) and ChIP experiments with Ctk1 (Cho et al, 2001) also suggest that these kinases function after initiation, we modified the protocol.
0402
There are at least two possible variations of this model that could explain the ChIP results (Figure 5G). In the first, basal factors release from the promoter in ctk1Δ cells, but remain associated with the polymerase as it moves through the gene body. In the second, RNApII actually remains tethered to the basal factors at the promoter while transcribing. This would result in the transcribing polymerase ‘pulling' the transcribed region past basal factors, thereby allowing cross-linking with downstream sequences.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (Ahn et al, 2004). For precipitation of TAP-tagged proteins, 10 μl of rabbit IgG agarose (Sigma) was incubated with chromatin solution overnight at 4°C. For Rpb1 (BWG16 Covance), Sua7, TBP, Kin28, Tfb1, Tfa2, and Rap1 (y-300, Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitations, the antibodies were preincubated with protein A-sepharose CL-4B (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with chromatin solution overnight at 4°C. For Rpb3 immunoprecipitation, antibody (1Y26, NeoClone) was preincubated with protein G-sepharose (Amersham). PCR amplification was performed with primer pairs as described (Ahn et al, 2004). PCR signals were quantitated by Fujix PhosphoImager. To control for amplification efficiency and label incorporation with different primers, the ratio of each gene-specific product to that of a non-transcribed region of chromosome V was calculated from the input sample signals. The signal for each specific gene primer in the immunoprecipitation was then divided by this ratio to convert the signal to normalized units. This value was divided by the immunoprecipitation signal of the non-transcribed control product to determine the fold enrichment of the ChIP over background signals. As this number is a ratio, a value of 1 represents ‘no signal' (i.e., a signal equal to background).

Ctk1 is necessary for the dissociation of basal transcription factors from elongating RNA polymerase II (RNApII). (A) Schematic of the PMA1, ADH1, and PYK1 genes. The UAS of each gene is indicated by an open box (see Figure 3C). The TATA/promoter region and open reading frames are represented by black and grey boxes, respectively. Arrows indicate the position of the major polyadenylation sites reported previously (Kim et al, 2004a) and bars below the genes show the relative positions of PCR products in ChIP analysis. (B) Occupancy of Rpb1 and basal transcription factors (Sua7, TBP, Kin28, Tfb1, Tfa2) at the indicated regions in WT (YSB726) or ctk1Δ (YSB854) cells.

The abnormal cross-linking of basal transcription factors in ctk1Δ cells is confirmed by independent immunoprecipitation of TAP-tagged TFIIF subunits.
