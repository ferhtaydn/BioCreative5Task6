According to a 2002 estimate, more than 1,100,000 patients were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, and approximately 410,000 patients died of the disease [1]. Recent improvements in detecting breast cancer at an early stage through mammographic screening have contributed to a decrease in breast cancer-associated mortality. Mastectomy is among the first options for treatment of localized breast cancer. Despite surgical removal of primary tumors, however, relapse at local or distant sites occurs in a subset of patients, probably due to undetectable micrometastases at the time of diagnosis [2,3].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3304</offset><text>Cancer therapies directed at specific molecular targets in signaling pathways of cancer cells, such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab (Herceptin), have been proven to be useful for treatment of advanced breast cancer [4]. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors suppress the estrogen-related signaling pathway and trastuzumab is the first approved monoclonal antibody for blocking the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2/ErbB-2) signaling pathway [4,5]. Patients with tumors that express estrogen or HER-2 receptors can benefit from either of these therapies and are expected to have a better quality of life and prognosis. However, increased risk of endometrial cancer with long-term tamoxifen administration and of bone fracture due to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy are recognized side effects [6,7]. Due to the emergence of these side effects and also because of drug resistance, it is necessary to search for novel molecular targets for drugs on the basis of well-characterized mechanisms of action.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4369</offset><text>Toward the goal of identifying good molecular targets for drug development, we analyzed the detailed expression profiles of 81 breast tumors, representing 23,040 genes, using a combination of laser-microbeam microdissection and cDNA microarray analysis [8]. After comparing the expression profiles of these breast cancers with those of various normal human tissues [9], we focused on a gene termed maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) that was significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cases examined.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4907</offset><text>In this study, we report evidence indicating that MELK functions as a cancer-specific protein kinase, and that down-regulation of MELK results in growth suppression of breast cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrate that MELK physically interacts and phosphorylates a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Our findings suggest that the kinase activity of MELK is likely to affect mammary carcinogenesis through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL.

The MELK gene (GenBank accession number NM_014791) was found to be one of the genes transactivated at a very high level in the great majority of the breast cancers examined. The subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the transcript confirmed the elevated expression of MELK in 11 of 12 clinical breast cancer specimens (Figure 1a).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25571</offset><text>To further examine the expression pattern of this gene in breast cancer cell lines and normal tissues, we performed Northern blot analyses with mRNAs from multiple human tissues and breast cancer cell lines using a cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of the MELK gene as a probe. The results showed that an approximately 2.7 kb band was most highly expressed in testis, and weakly expressed in thymus and small intestine (Figure 1b). Interestingly, Northern blot analyses of breast cancer cell lines using the same probe showed that 2.4 to 2.7 kb bands were significantly over-expressed in breast cancer cells but were not expressed in vital organs (Figure 1c), indicating that some cancer specific transcripts are present over this range.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26333</offset><text>To characterize the variants specifically transcribed in breast cancer cells, we screened a cDNA library of breast cancer cells. Subsequent cDNA sequencing analysis identified three different transcriptional variants, designated V1 (2,501 bp; NM_014791), V2 (2,368 bp; AB183427) and V3 (2,251 bp; AB183428). These three different transcriptional variants consist of 18, 17 and 16 exons, respectively. The V2 variant lacks exon 3 (86 bp) and the V3 variant lacks exon 3 (86 bp) and exon 4 (117 bp) as a result of alternative splicing (Figure 1d). The V2 and V3 variants contain early stop codons (TGA) in exon 4 and exon 5, respectively, if they are translated from the same first ATG codon of the V1 variant. However, if they are translated from a second ATG codon located downstream of the first ATG codon of the V1 variant, the V2 and V3 variant proteins are thought to produce 618 and 581 amino acid peptides, respectively. Thus, to examine both possibilities, we carried out an in vitro translation assay and found that the V1, V2 and V3 proteins were 75, 71 and 66 kDa, respectively, indicating that the V2 and V3 proteins were translated from the second ATG codon (Figure 1e).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27516</offset><text>Subsequently, we examined MELK expression in breast cancer cell lines by western blot analysis with anti-MELK polyclonal antibodies. The results indicate that the V1 protein is dominantly overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared with the V2 and V3 proteins (Figure 1f). Furthermore, although all of the three variant proteins possess the KA1 domain in their carboxyl terminus, the V2 and V3 proteins lack the amino-terminal portion, which corresponds to the first 48 amino acids of the V1 protein and is considered to be the catalytic kinase domain (Figure 1g). Although we can not rule out the possibility that the V2 and V3 variants have some functional role in carcinogenesis, for example, dominant-negative functions, in this study we focus on the kinase activity of the V1 transcript due to its predominant expression in cancer cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28361</offset><text>Growth-inhibitory effects of siRNA against MELK</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28409</offset><text>To assess a possible role of MELK in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous MELK in the breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 (Figure 2a,b), in which MELK was overexpressed at a high level, by means of the mammalian vector-based RNAi technique (see Materials and methods).

We first confirmed the exogenous expression of MELK and Bcl-GL in COS7 cells by western blot analysis (Figure 5a). As indicated in Figure 5b,c, the overexpression of full-length Bcl-GL (HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-GL) significantly increased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the cells transfected with the mock plasmids (HA-Mock+Flag-Mock), indicating that Bcl-GL induces apoptosis, as described previously [14]. In contrast, the co-overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-GL (HA-WT-MELK+Flag-Bcl-GL) reduced the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with over-expression of Bcl-GL alone (HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-GL) (P = 0.0001, unpaired t-test). However, the co-overexpression of D150A-MELK with Bcl-GL (HA-D150A-MELK+Flag-Bcl-GL) did not affect the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells. As shown in Figure 5d, FACS analysis of the cells under the same conditions also confirmed that the overexpression of Bcl-GL increased the sub-G1 population of cells compared with the mock-transfected cells. Similarly to the TUNEL analysis, the overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-GL reduced the proportion of sub-G1 cells (P = 0.03, unpaired t-test), while D150A-MELK increased the sub-G1 population.

This gene was shown to play an important role in hematopoiesis, stem cell renewal [19] and cell-cycle progression through an interaction with zinc finger-like protein ZPR9 [20] and splicing factor NIPP1 [12]. To investigate the expression pattern of these proteins in breast cancer cells, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and observed no significant correlation of gene expression between MELK and these interacting molecules in breast cancer cells (data not shown). Thus, to investigate the biological significance of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for a possible substrate(s) of MELK by means of in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK). We identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a potential substrate for MELK. In addition to physical interaction between these two proteins, in vitro immune complex kinase and in vitro binding assays showed that Bcl-GL was directly bound to MELK and specifically phosphorylated by it in vitro (Figures 3d and 4a,b).</text><annotation id="29"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="38120" length="243"/><text>Thus, to investigate the biological significance of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for a possible substrate(s) of MELK by means of in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38730</offset><text>As reported previously [14], we demonstrated by TUNEL assay and FACS analysis that introduction of full-length Bcl-GL into COS7 cells induced apoptosis.

Recent anti-cancer drug development is focused on targeting important molecules involved in the oncogenic pathways, represented by imatinib mesylate and trastuzumab. We found that down-regulation of MELK by treatment with siRNA significantly suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer, indicating its crucial role in the proliferation and tumorgenesis of breast cancer. In particular, we demonstrate a new biological function for MELK in breast carcinogenesis, the inhibition of apoptosis though its interaction with and phosphorylation of Bcl-GL, a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family. Our data should contribute to a better understanding of breast carcinogenesis, and they suggest that MELK is a promising molecular target for breast cancer treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>40152</offset><text>Abbreviations</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40166</offset><text>β2MG = beta-2-microglobulin; DTT = dithiothreitol; GST = glutathione S-transferase; Her-2/ErbB-2 = epidermal growth factor 2; HMEC = human mammary epithelial cell; MTT = 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi = RNA interference; SC = scramble control.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>40480</offset><text>Competing interests</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40500</offset><text>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>40559</offset><text>Authors' contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40582</offset><text>LML performed all experiments and drafted the manuscript.

Four psiH1 promoter-based siRNA constructs (si-#1, si-#2, si-#3 and si-#4) were introduced into (a) T47D and (b) MCF-7 cell lines. SC refers to scramble used as a control for siRNA experiments. Gene silencing was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses at four and five days after neomycin selection, respectively. β2-microglobulin (β2MG) was used as a control for normalization of semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and β-actin was used as a control in western blot analysis. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were performed to evaluate cell viability at 10 days after neomycin selection, and graphed after standardization using the scramble control (SC) as 1.0 (T47D, P = 0.0003, P = 0.0013; MCF-7, P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001; unpaired t-test). Colony formation assays were carried out three weeks after neomycin selection (see Materials and methods). Two siRNA constructs (si-#3 and -#4) showed significant knockdown effects against internal MELK expression and inhibited cell growth in both T47D (a) and MCF-7 (b) cell lines. Values represent the average from triplicate experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>46109</offset><text>Identification of Bcl-GL as an interacting protein for MELK. (a) Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels that contained the pulled-down cell lysates. The enlarged area covering Bcl-G shows the differential interaction between it and wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK). (b) Expression of Bcl-GL in eight breast cancer cell lines as well as human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) by western blot analysis with an anti-Bcl-GL antibody. β-Actin was used as a control. (c) Interaction of MELK with Bcl-GL. Extracts from HeLa-cells transfected with HA (hemagglutinin)-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) or Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL), or a combination of these, were harvested 36 hours after transfection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibody. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis was performed with an anti-HA antibody. (d) Direct interaction of the MELK and Bcl-GL proteins. The upper panel indicates the amount of input of WT-MELK and D150A-MELK. His-tagged WT-MELK bound to Bcl-GL, but His-tagged D150A-MELK did not. (e) Schematic representation of the amino- and carboxy-terminal deletion constructs of Bcl-GL. The C-1 and C-2 constructs have the BH2 domain deleted, and the C-3 construct has both the BH2 and BH3 domains deleted. (f) Determination of the WT-MELK binding regions of Bcl-GL by immunoprecipitation. The HA-tagged WT-MELK and various peptide sequences of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Figure 3e) were pulled down by immunoprecipitation with Flag-M2 antibody and then immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Flag antibody. The expression of HA-tagged WT-MELK in total cell lysates was confirmed by western blotting analysis. As a control, immunoprecipitation was performed from cells co-transfected with pCAGGSn3FC (Mock) and HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) through all steps.
