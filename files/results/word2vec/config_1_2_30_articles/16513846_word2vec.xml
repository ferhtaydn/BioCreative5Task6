Translational fusions with the green fluorescent protein showed that STM is not nuclear by default. In a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with a meristem-enriched cDNA library, three interacting BLH (Bel1-like homeodomain) transcription factors were identified. According to bimolecular fluorescence complementation, STM is targeted into the nuclear compartment through heterodimerization with BLH partner proteins, which are expressed in distinct SAM domains from the center to the periphery. On a functional level, overexpression experiments in transgenic Arabidopsis plants suggest that individual heterodimers provide distinct contributions. These results contribute to our understanding of the STM transcription factor function in the SAM and also shed new light on the evolution of the TALE-HD super gene family in animal and plant lineages.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="422" length="99"/><text>Translational fusions with the green fluorescent protein showed that STM is not nuclear by default.</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="522" length="162"/><text>In a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with a meristem-enriched cDNA library, three interacting BLH (Bel1-like homeodomain) transcription factors were identified.</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0809</infon><location offset="685" length="231"/><text>According to bimolecular fluorescence complementation, STM is targeted into the nuclear compartment through heterodimerization with BLH partner proteins, which are expressed in distinct SAM domains from the center to the periphery.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1271</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1284</offset><text>The aerial organs of angiosperm plants, leaves, stem and flowers arise through activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which initiates new organs in a predictable and regular pattern. The SAM is a highly organized group of cells which can be divided into distinct domains with different functions (1–3). The central zone is involved in meristem maintenance and provides a permanent source of stem cells. Surrounding this is the peripheral zone, where new primordia are initiated. Although the SAM appears as an extremely stable structure, its individual cells divide and have to acquire new fates before they finally differentiate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1923</offset><text>The gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is required for the initiation and maintenance of the SAM in Arabidopsis. Embryos homozygous for strong loss-of-function mutations in the STM gene form cotyledons and other embryonic structures but fail to establish a population of self-renewing stem cells (4,5). Characteristic cell divisions that generate the typical tunica/corpus organization are also missing in stm mutant embryos. Plants homozygous for weak stm alleles form SAMs but these are prone to premature termination (6,7). STM encodes a Knotted-like homeodomain-containing protein and is likely to act as a transcriptional regulator in promoting SAM development and maintenance [(7) and recently reviewed in (8,9)]. This assumption is supported by the transcription pattern, as STM activity is restricted to the SAM but down-regulated in founder cells (P0) of newly arising lateral organ primordia (5).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2825</offset><text>The STM homeodomain (HD) belongs to the three amino acid loop extension (TALE) class of homeodomains. A second conserved protein motif is the KNOX domain, more generally known as the MEINOX domain (10). Although initially identified in plant Knotted-related homeobox genes, the KNOX domain was subsequently also found in animal myeloid ecotropic viral integration site (MEIS) proteins. This combination of MEINOX and TALE-HD domains in animal and plant proteins is suggestive of a common ancestry (11). Whereas the TALE-HD serves to interact with DNA-target sites, the MEINOX domain in animal proteins has been shown to mediate interactions with a second group of TALE-HD proteins—the pre-B cell (PBC) class (12–16). Also in plants there is accumulating evidence that the MEINOX/TALE-HD proteins interact with a second class of TALE-HD gene products, the BEL1-like homeodomain (BLH) proteins (17–19). In total, the Arabidopsis genome contains 12 BLH genes, besides BEL1 (20) and the founding member ATH1 (21) systematically numbered BLH1 to BLH10. A functional interaction between plant MEINOX-HD and BLH genes is substantiated by the synergism observed when pennywise a null-allele of BLH9 (18), allelic to bellringer, replumless, vaamana (19,22,23) is combined with the brevipedicellus1 (bp1) mutant (24). Guided by an evolutionarily conserved structure and heterodimerization of two TALE-HD super gene family members in plants and animals, it has been proposed that KNOX/BLH as MEIS/PBC genes share a common ancestry (25). However, amino acid sequence conservation outside the homeodomain gene is low, although members of the plant BLH or animal PBC gene families each share a typical and lineage-specific domain, the BELL domain and the bipartite PBC-A/B domain, respectively (11,17,25,26).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4626</offset><text>In contrast to divergence of the BELL and the PBC-A/B domains, the MEINOX domain is highly conserved between plant KNOX and animal MEIS proteins. The MEINOXSTM domain is essential for STM function, as overexpression of the isolated MEINOXSTM domain strongly phenocopies stm loss-of function alleles (27). This dominant-negative function upon expression of the MEINOXSTM domain is strengthened in combination with the Drosophila engrailed repressor domain and best explained by squelching: the abundant MEINOXSTM domain depleting the native STM protein from essential interaction partners. Interestingly, although BREVIPEDICELLUS1 (BP1) is thought to act redundantly with STM in the SAM (24) the same experiment performed with the MEINOXBP1 domain results in bp1 mutant phenocopies (27). Putative protein interactions mediated by the MEINOXSTM domains therefore exhibit selectivity, consistent with domain-swap experiments performed with NTH1 and NTH15 in transgenic tobacco (28).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5606</offset><text>We initiated a search for potential STM interaction partner genes starting from a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with the MEINOXSTM domain as bait for a meristem-enriched cDNA library. However, in planta analysis of protein–protein interactions demonstrated that the transcription factor STM is not an obligatory nuclear protein but that nuclear uptake depends on partner proteins. Described here are experiments with three different BLH partner proteins, which target STM into the nuclear compartment and which are expressed in distinct SAM subdomains. Combinatorial gain-of-function experiments in transgenic Arabidopsis plants provide evidence that individual STM/BLH heterodimers may provide different functions.</text><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="5606" length="187"/><text>We initiated a search for potential STM interaction partner genes starting from a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with the MEINOXSTM domain as bait for a meristem-enriched cDNA library.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6328</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6350</offset><text>Yeast two-hybrid screen and immature inflorescence library</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6409</offset><text>The Matchmaker GAL4 system (Clontech) was used to perform the yeast two-hybrid screen.

As a prerequisite to substantiate interactions between potential partner proteins identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, C- and N-terminal fusions between the ORFs of STM and the GFP were constructed and expressed in leek or onion epidermal cells after particle bombardment. As a potential transcription factor, STM was expected to direct GFP fluorescence into the plant cell nucleus. However, both fusion proteins, GFP-STM and STM-GFP remained in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B and C). The same result was obtained in epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. In contrast, the addition of the virD2 NLS (33) in front of the chimeric GFP-STM ORF efficiently directed the chimeric NLS-GFP-STM protein into the plant cell nucleus (Figure 1D). An inappropriate folding of the N- or C-terminal GFP fusion proteins is unlikely, because expression of both chimeric proteins (GFP-STM + STM-GFP) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants behind the CaMV35S promoter yielded the characteristic STM overexpression phenotype (data not shown). However, in contrast to ectopic STM activity affecting the SAM or causing meristems on leaves (37), the expression of a nuclear targeted NLS-STM version from the CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis plant predominantly resulted in a lobed leaf phenotype (Figure 1E), which is reminiscent of KNAT1 overexpression (38) rather than STM over expression (37). Lobed leaves were detected in 187 (76%) from 247 primary transformants (T1), whereas only 44 (18%) T1 plants showed meristem defects including stm phenocopies, presumably due to co-suppression. A nuclear-targeted STM protein version therefore affects leaf development more than SAM function.</text><annotation id="10"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0809</infon><location offset="15266" length="119"/><text>The method of choice to prove a physical interaction between candidate partner proteins in plant cells is BiFC (31,36).</text></annotation><annotation id="11"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="15386" length="276"/><text>As a prerequisite to substantiate interactions between potential partner proteins identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, C- and N-terminal fusions between the ORFs of STM and the GFP were constructed and expressed in leek or onion epidermal cells after particle bombardment.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17063</offset><text>The cytoplasmic retention of the chimeric GFP-STM protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of nuclei with propidium iodide.

Additional support for nuclear exclusion was obtained by several STM deletion constructs, none of which targeted GFP fluorescence to the plant cell nucleus (data not shown).

RT–PCR experiments readily detected BLH3 transcripts at the 2–4 leaf seedling stage (data not shown). Combined in Figure 3 are the cellular transcription patterns in immature inflorescences, where the indeterminate inflorescence meristem (IM) and determinate FMs can be compared. All three BLH genes are transcribed in IMs and FMs. High levels of ATH1 transcripts are generally detected in the center of the IM or FM and an additional stripe of ATH1 expression is found in the FM (to the left in Figure 3B), which is adjacent to a lateral organ primordium. In contrast, BLH3 is transcribed in a cup-shaped expression domain enclosing the ATH1 domain, whereas BLH3 transcripts are absent in the centre of the IM (Figure 3C and D). The BLH9 transcription pattern has been analysed on the cellular level previously (22); a section is included in Figure 3 to show its preference at the SAM periphery (Figure 3E). The in situ hybridizations with ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 probes therefore suggest a zonation of the IM, from the center to the periphery. In contrast, STM (Figure 3A) is ubiquitously transcribed throughout the SAM and only down-regulated when cells acquire primordial fate at the SAM periphery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>22059</offset><text>Heterodimerization with BLH partners directs STM into the plant cell nucleus</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22136</offset><text>The principle of BiFC is the formation of a fluorescent complex by fragments of the enhanced YFP brought together by the association of two interaction partners (31,36).

The BiFC results therefore, confirm that full-length STM and BLH proteins interact in plant cells, but more notably, that BLH/STM heterodimers are efficiently incorporated into the nuclear compartment. Expectedly, the GFP-ATH1, GFP-BLH3 and GFP-BLH9 fusion proteins exerted a preference for the nuclear compartment (Figure 4D–F). The nuclear import of GFP-BLH9 in leek epidermal cells appears to be in contrast to previous results obtained in tobacco leaves after agroinfection with a C-terminal BLH9-GFP fusion construct. However, without analysing the cellular localization of the STM protein, Bhatt et al.

In contrast to bombardments with the ATH1 and BLH3 constructs, the number of BiFC-positive cells obtained with the BLH9/STM combination (e.g. BLH9-NYFP/STM-CYFP in Figure 4C) was generally low.

An effective NLS therefore must be located in the BLH3 protein N-terminal to its BELL domain. In the STM protein, the MEINOXSTM domain is sufficient to interact with full-length BLH3 (Figure 4J). However, we have been unable to reconstitute YFP fluorescence in BiFC experiments with the isolated MEINOXSTM and BELLBLH3 domains although several compatible N- or C-terminal combinations with each YFP sub-domain were tested.

For this purpose, we first raised and analysed transgenic lines expressing individual BLH genes behind the CaMV 35S promoter. The most evident phenotype in primary transformants (T1) was observed with ectopic ATH1 gene activity, which affected the elongation of internodes in inflorescence shoots. The severest phenotype, essentially an absence of internode elongation was observed in 40 from total of 240 BASTA-resistent progeny (compare Figure 5A with B). Normal and fertile flowers emerged in an appropriate phyllotaxy from a stunted, compact inflorescence, a phenotype inherited up to the T4 generation. Some reduction in inflorescence height (∼20–30%) was also observed in T1 BLH9 overexpressing plants (30 from total of 65 transgenic seedlings); however, this phenotype was not heritable in subsequent generations. In addition, BLH9 overexpression caused alterations in phyllotaxy and phenotypes (Figure 5C and D) reminiscent of those described for loss-of-function alleles e.g. multiple cauline leaves subtending second order inflorescence shoots, multiple axillary shoots emerging from a single inflorescence node or irregular elongation of internodes [bellringer, pennywise, replumless, vaamana (18,19,22,23)]. In contrast, T1 BLH3 overexpressing plants (total >200) appeared similar to wild type, although independent lines in the T2 generation were early flowering compared with wild-type plants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28090</offset><text>For each BLH candidate partner protein gene two representative T2 overexpressing lines were crossed into the STM-GR background. To discriminate single from double-transgenic plants, T3 progeny of these lines were subjected to a detailed phenotypic analysis (Figure 5E). Overexpression of either BLH3 or BLH9 caused early flowering compared with Columbia wild-type controls, whereas ATH1 transgenic progeny flowered much later. With P-values ranging from 0.002 (BLH9) or 0.00001 (BLH3) to 0.000002 (ATH1) in the student's t-test, these differences in flowering time are highly significant. In BLH3 overexpressing plants early flowering is reflected by a reduced leaf number compared with Columbia control plants (8 or 10 leaves on average, respectively; Figure 5E). In contrast, BLH9 transgenic plants flowered at the same time as BLH3 overexpressing plants, but developed more rosette leaves. BHL9 overexpressing plants flowered three days earlier than wild-type controls and produced on average one more leaf than wild type. The plastochron was estimated to be 1.41 for wild type, whereas BLH9 overexpressing plants developed a new leaf approximately every day. This difference was confirmed in a third BLH9 transgenic line and is highly significant (P = 0.00013). In contrast no significant deviation in the plastochron was observed in 35S::BLH3 or 35S::ATH1 transgenic plants compared with the wild type (Figure 5E). However, transgenic ATH1 plants flowered on average 4 days later than wild-type Columbia control plants and developed on average three more leaves than the wild type. The overexpression of three BLH genes, which are potential interaction partners of STM in the SAM therefore consistently affected flowering time either by altering the number of vegetative leaves (BLH3/ATH1) or the plastochron (BLH9).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29912</offset><text>F1 seeds obtained from crosses between STM-GR and BLH3, BLH9 or ATH1 overexpressing lines were sown on soil and monitored for transmission of the potential STM partner protein transgene by selection for BASTA resistance. The surviving seedlings of the individual crosses and lines were subdivided into three groups and either sprayed with Dexamethasone (Dex) at the 2–3 or 5–6 leaf stage, or third group serving as an untreated control. Since the 35S::STM-GR effector transgene is propagated heterozygously, only 50% of the progeny can respond to the hormone treatment by releasing the chimeric STM-GR protein from cytoplasmic retention (40). When induced at the early 2–3 leaf stage, STM-GR control plants remained in the vegetative phase with newly initiated leaflets which were small and remained closely associated with the SAM (Figure 6A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30763</offset><text>In contrast, BLH3/STM-GR and ATH1/STM-GR double-transgene combinations ceased producing leaf primordia and instead initiated FMs (Figure 6B and C). Young leaflets already initiated at the time of Dex application expanded but lacked petioles and in consequence remained in close association to the SAM. The release of STM-GR from cytoplasmic retention in two independent lines providing either ectopic ATH1 or ectopic BLH3 activity therefore transforms meristem identity from vegetative to reproductive. A different response to Dex application was observed in the combination BLH9/STM-GR; these plants remained in the vegetative phase but initiated new leaves which were severely lobed (Figure 6D). Plants sprayed later, at the 5 or 6 leaf-stage also responded to Dex application. However, some STM-GR control plants started flowering shortly thereafter, as did each double-transgene combination. Floral induction at this late stage, therefore, may be biased by STM-GR overexpression. Noteworthy is that cauline leaves in BLH9/STM-GR transgenic plants remained severely lobed, thus confirming specificity of this additive leaf phenotype. Characteristic for STM-GR flowers are abnormalities such as a size reduction in outer whorl organs and a prominent carpel surrounded by few stamens (32). These features are shared by flowers emerging from early or late Dex-induced double-transgene combinations (see also Figure 6C). Although this phenotype provides evidence for STM-GR expression, the co-activity of both transgenes was confirmed by RNA-gel blot experiments with pooled explant material for each transgene combination (data not shown). No additional phenotype was observed in the no-DEX control group, single-transgene STM-GR plants or untreated double-transgene combinations. In conclusion, these additive combinatorial transgene results provide strong evidence that the overexpression of three BLH partner proteins in transgenic Arabidopsis plants creates novel functional competencies, which are realized after STM-GR is released from the HSP90 chaperonin. Two discrete phenotypes, floral induction and leaf lobing indicate response specificity, and more importantly imply that individual BLH proteins may contribute different functions through their interaction with STM.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>33043</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>33054</offset><text>Domain specificity of STM heterodimers in the SAM and functional differences</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33131</offset><text>Although expressed throughout the Arabidopsis SAM, we have shown here that the homeodomain transcription factor STM is devoid of an efficient NLS and does not enter the nucleus by default.

According to our BiFC results, however, STM is targeted into the nucleus as a heterodimer with ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9. A passive co-transport is also not in contradiction to the nuclear localization of STM-GFP in the L2 or L3 layers of the SAM (41) if nuclear-targeting partner proteins such as ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 are readily available. However, an intriguing aspect of BLH gene expression in the SAM is their confinement to discrete SAM sub-domains. Disregarding possible post-transcriptional control mechanisms, the STM transcription factor encounters ATH1 preferentially in the centre of the SAM, followed by BLH3 and finally BLH9 moving towards the IM periphery.</text><annotation id="25"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0809</infon><location offset="33588" length="115"/><text>According to our BiFC results, however, STM is targeted into the nucleus as a heterodimer with ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34253</offset><text>All three BLH partner protein genes are already transcriptionally active during the vegetetative phase [(21,22), BLH3 data not shown]; however, ectopic expression of ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 behind the CaMV 35S promoter altered flowering time. BLH9 and BLH3 overexpression caused early flowering, whereas ectopic ATH1 activity caused a delay. The link between BLH gene activity and flowering time control is further strengthened by the additive phenotype observed after induction of STM-GR in the pre-conditioned ectopic ATH1 or BLH3 background resulting in floral induction. ATH1 and BLH3 both are expressed in the center of the IM whereas BLH9 is transcribed at the periphery and in combination with BLH9 the release of STM-GR by Dex caused leaf lobing. In ligand blot experiments, BHL9 reportedly interacts with the MEINOXBP1 domain and only weakly with the MEINOXSTM domain (18). However, double-mutant analyses (stm-2/bellringer) showed that BLH9 can compensate for reduced STM activity (22), although another allele pennywise appears to act synergistically with bp1 (18). The phenotype obtained here after Dex induction of STM-GR in the ectopic BLH9 overexpression background is reminiscent of BP1/KNAT1 overexpression (38), which is mimicked by the ectopic expression of a nuclear targeted NLS-STM protein version (Figure 1E). Although leaf lobing does not necessarily relate to SAM function, this novel phenotype depends on the combination of the STM-GR and BHL9 proteins. Leaf-lobing is not observed in single transgenic lines and one possibility compatible with the NLS-STM results is that BLH9 mediates nuclear import of STM-GR in leaf cells (compare Figure 1E with Figure 6D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35937</offset><text>The transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase is controlled by environmental and/or intrinsic developmental cues that converge at the SAM (1,2). In consequence, the vegetative meristem undergoes morphological changes and new growth patterns required for flowering are established. An essential contribution of BLH genes to floral induction has been shown in Arabidopsis plants containing null mutations in two paralogous BLH genes, PENNYWISE (pny a BLH9 allele) and POUND-FOOLISH [pnf a BLH8 allele; (42)]. pny/pnf double mutants are completely unable to flower even though the SAM displays morphological and molecular changes that are consistent with it having received floral inductive signals. Our gain-of-function data with BLH3 and ATH1 not only provide further evidence that BLH gene products influence floral induction pathways, but suggest that MEINOX proteins such as STM may be contributing partners. In contrast to the pny/pnf double-mutant data, no direct support for a role for BLH9 in floral induction was obtained during this study, however, based on genetic data, the native partner of BLH9 may be BP1 not STM (18,22).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37083</offset><text>Admittedly, all the combinatorial phenotypes result from ectopic protein activity throughout the plant and by no means reflect functional interactions restricted to the SAM.

This combinatorial effect suggests a functional interaction of STM with BLH proteins in planta, but both the leaf lobing and the floral induction phenotype must be interpreted cautiously with respect to overexpression. On the spatial level, the STM expression domain in the Arabidopsis SAM overlaps with the transcription patterns of all three BLH genes and the distinct phenotypes observed with ATH1 and BLH3 or BLH9 overexpression therefore suggest that STM may provide different functional contributions at the centre of the apex than at its periphery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>37992</offset><text>Heterodimerization to control nuclear import: an ancient paradigm in the TALE HD super gene family</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38091</offset><text>BLH proteins comprise one of two TALE-HD protein subfamilies in plants (10), STM is the most prominent member of the MEINOX protein sub-branch in Arabidopsis. Our findings that STM resides in the cytoplasm but is nuclear in heterodimers with BLH partners is reminiscent of the situation in animals, where nuclear import of MEIS proteins is directed by heterodimerization with PBC gene products. For example, the Drosophila exd (extradenticle) gene is transcribed and translated in most embryonic cells but its function is regulated through sub-cellular localization. EXD sub-cellular distribution is regulated by heterodimerization with the product of the homothorax (hth) gene product, an interaction which depends on the presence of the MEINOXHTH domain. In Drosophila leg imaginal discs, the EXD protein is nuclear localized in proximal regions, which correspond to the expression domain of the HTH protein. Conversely, in distal parts, where HTH is not present, EXD is cytoplasmic [(12,16,14), reviewed in (43)]. The accepted scheme of nuclear import control of MEINOX TALE-HD proteins through interaction with the second class of TALE-HD proteins, BLH or PBC in plants and animals, respectively, suggests an ancient and conserved mechanism. In animals, the interaction between PBC and MEINOX proteins requires integrity of the bipartite PBC-A and B domains in the PBC and the MEINOX domain in MEIS proteins (13). Co-immunoprecipitation and BiFC experiments performed in the course of this study show that the MEINOXSTM and the BELLBLH3 domains are sufficient for interaction in vitro and in planta.</text><annotation id="26"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0809</infon><location offset="39509" length="185"/><text>Co-immunoprecipitation and BiFC experiments performed in the course of this study show that the MEINOXSTM and the BELLBLH3 domains are sufficient for interaction in vitro and in planta.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39695</offset><text>Based on protein–protein interaction data, the animal PBC-A/B domain finds its counterpart in the BELL domain of plant BLH proteins although conservation at the amino acid level is weak.

However, the finding that nuclear import of STM is mediated by heterodimerization with BLH partner proteins in plants strengthens the alternative hypothesis, that KNOX/MEIS and BLH/PBC precursor genes may have already existed in a common ancestor of animals and plants (11,17).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40572</offset><text>This assumption implies a significant tolerance for divergence of the BELL and PBC-A/B domain other than for the MEINOX partner domain. Part of the explanation could reside in the conservation of secondary structure, since the BELL and PBC-A/B domains still share a pronounced bipartite helical organization. Another possibility is that the BELL or PBC-A/B domains may be more prone to acquisition of novel functions than the MEINOX domain. In the zebrafish Prep1 protein, the MEINOX domain is sufficient to provide MEIS activity to a PBX/HOX complex (13). Its DNA-binding homeodomain is dispensable as in Arabidopsis, where overexpression of the MEINOXSTM or MEINOXBP1 domains trans-dominantly phenocopy stm or bp1 loss-of function mutants, respectively (27). MEIS/PBX heterodimers in animals interact with various other transcription factors, including HOX or bHLH gene products (13,44,45) and improve specificity through formation of multimeric complexes with PBX/MEIS proteins, which is important for patterning of the anterior/posterior axis (46). If the MEINOX domain provides a central backbone for an assembly of multimeric complexes in animals as in plants, such functional constraints could easily explain its conservation during evolution. Alternatively, an intriguing aspect of animal PBC protein function is its regulation at the post-translational level, a mechanism that also plays a crucial role in animal patterning processes [(47), reviewed in (48)]. The PBC-B domain contains several conserved phosphorylation sites for Ser/Thr kinases and PBX1 sub-cellular localization correlates with the phosphorylation state of these residues whose dephosphorylation induces nuclear export (49). Any freedom in the PBC domain to tolerate mutations better than the MEINOX domain would allow the acquisition of new functions and therefore explain differences between the plant BLH and animal PBC lineages.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42483</offset><text>The evolutionary conservation of a functional interaction between members of two families of TALE-HD gene products, MEIS/PBX and KNOX/BLH proteins in animals or plants, respectively, suggests an ancient and possibly extant function. In the multimeric complexes involved in animal patterning processes, PBX proteins reportedly interact with transcriptional corepressors such as histone-deacetylases or N-CoR/SMRT (50). Recent data demonstrate that PBC/MEIS heterodimers penetrate repressive chromatin to mark specific genes for activation e.g. by myoD (44). The finding that dominant mutations in the miRNA target site of PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA, which effect adaxial/abaxial patterning of the Arabidopsis leaf correlate with changes of DNA methylation outside the SAM (51) or that the floral repressor FLC is prone to epigenetic silencing by histone methylation (52) indicates that chromatin changes accompany developmental decisions such as primordial cell fate or flowering time in plants. An extant aspect of STM/BLH function thus could be the activation or the repression of transcriptionally competent chromatin.
