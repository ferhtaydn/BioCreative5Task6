Two different models of Bcl-XL function have been proposed. In one, Bcl-XL binds to an activator, thereby preventing Bax activation. In the other, Bcl-XL binds directly to activated Bax. It has been difficult to sort out which interaction is important in cells, as all three proteins are present simultaneously. We examined the mechanism of Bax activation by tBid and its inhibition by Bcl-XL using full-length recombinant proteins and measuring permeabilization of liposomes and mitochondria in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-XL and Bax are functionally similar. Neither protein bound to membranes alone. However, the addition of tBid recruited molar excesses of either protein to membranes, indicating that tBid activates both pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-XL competes with Bax for the activation of soluble, monomeric Bax through interaction with membranes, tBid, or t-Bid-activated Bax, thereby inhibiting Bax binding to membranes, oligomerization, and membrane permeabilization. Experiments in which individual interactions were abolished by mutagenesis indicate that both Bcl-XL–tBid and Bcl-XL–Bax binding contribute to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. By out-competing Bax for the interactions leading to membrane permeabilization, Bcl-XL ties up both tBid and Bax in nonproductive interactions and inhibits Bax binding to membranes. We propose that because Bcl-XL does not oligomerize it functions like a dominant-negative Bax in the membrane permeabilization process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1801</offset><text>Author Summary</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1816</offset></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1817</offset><text>During development and under stress, cells can become committed to die via programmed cell death (apoptosis). In most cases, the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane is a key component of this commitment. The membrane permeablization step is both positively and negatively regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. One member of this protein family with only a BH3 region, such as tBid, activates another family member, Bax, causing it to form large complexes that generate membrane-spanning pores, hence making the membrane permeable. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-XL, are structurally similar to Bax but inhibit the membrane permeabilization process by an unknown mechanism. Two mutually exclusive models have been proposed to explain how the Bcl-2 family is operating: one states that Bcl-XL binds to tBid, thereby preventing Bax activation, while the second suggests that Bcl-XL binds directly to activated Bax. It has been difficult to sort out which interaction is important in cells, where multiple members of all three protein families are present simultaneously. Here, we describe an in vitro system containing the three recombinant proteins and the use of mutagenesis to selectively remove individual interactions. We show that Bcl-XL inhibits Bax by competing with it for binding to membranes, tBid, and activated Bax. Because Bcl-XL does not form pores, it inhibits apoptosis by acting as if it is a dominant-negative version of Bax.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>3316</offset><text>Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar members of the Bcl-2 family of cell-death-related proteins, and they compete for binding to membranes, as well as to Bcl-2 family member tBid and activated Bax.

Apoptosis may be initiated by a developmental program and by many diverse forms of cell stress. A critical feature of metazoan apoptosis is the permeabilization of intracellular organellar membranes that leads to the egress of intraorganellar components that activate the proteases responsible for cell death. Bcl-2 is the founding member of a family that includes members that either prevent (e.g., Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL) or promote (e.g., Bax or Bak) the membrane permeabilization that leads to apoptosis. Another large subgroup of the Bcl-2 family (BH3-only proteins; e.g., tBid) initiates apoptosis through binding to Bax and/or Bcl-XL. Even though Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar, experiments with protein fragments and peptides or full-length protein in the absence of membranes has led to the elaboration of models in which the functional relevance of binding partners for Bcl-XL differ. The direct activation [1,2] or hierarchical model [3] states that Bcl-XL and other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit apoptosis primarily through interactions with a subclass of BH3-only proteins termed “activators”, preventing them from activating Bax and Bak. The indirect activation model [4,5] proposes that the function of all BH3-only proteins is to displace the inhibitory Bcl-XL from inherently active Bax or Bak. Thus, these two models differ primarily in whether Bax/Bak is constituively active or requires activation and which interactions are crucial to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. However, there is also considerable overlap between these two competing models: both models recognize that Bcl-XL directly binds to and inhibits a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is directly involved in membrane permeabilization, while other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins indirectly induce apoptosis by binding to Bcl-XL and preventing this function. Moreover, some authors postulate that both models may be relevant in different cell types or in the same cell type under different circumstances (e.g., normal versus cancerous) [2,6]. Our previous results have demonstrated the importance of dynamic interaction of Bcl-2 family members with membranes [7–9]. On the basis of these data and evidence from the literature, we have proposed a model termed “embedded together”, in which interaction of these proteins with each other changes after binding to the membrane as this causes conformational changes that alter and/or expose new binding surfaces [10,11]. Accordingly, a key feature for resolving differences in the components and mechanisms of physiologically relevant interactions between Bcl-2 family members is to examine these interactions in membranes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6602</offset><text>To examine the molecular mechanism of membrane permeabilization for full-length Bcl-XL and Bax, we used recombinant proteins and measured permeabilization of both liposomes and mitochondrial outer membranes in vitro. Recombinant tBid was used as an activator protein. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-XL and Bax, despite having opposite effects on apoptosis, share many functionally similar features: in the absence of an activator, neither protein bound tightly to membranes, whereas the addition of membrane-bound tBid to Bax or Bcl-XL recruited a similar molar excess of the soluble protein to membranes. However, after binding to membranes, only Bax formed large oligomers and permeabilized the membrane. Bcl-XL competes with Bax for binding to both tBid and membrane-bound Bax as well as for binding to membranes. In all cases, interaction of Bax with Bcl-XL is nonproductive for membrane permeabilization, presumably because Bcl-XL does not oligomerize. Thus, we propose that Bcl-XL functions similarly to a dominant-negative Bax in tBid-initiated membrane permeabilization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7683</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7691</offset><text>To inhibit membrane permeabilization, Bcl-XL might inhibit any or all of the interactions of Bax and its activator with each other or with membranes. There are many potential activators of Bax, including but not limited to the BH3-only proteins Bid, Bim, and Puma as well as other non-Bcl-2 family proteins such as p53 [12,13] and Bif-1 [14,15]. While studies using cells or animals in which specific components of the apoptotic pathway have been eliminated have contributed substantially to our understanding, it would be technically difficult if not impossible to create mouse stains with all of the relevant genes knocked out. Hence, precisely which step(s) in the process are inhibited by Bcl-XL as well as the molecular mechanism of inhibition can be best determined by using a cell-free system in which each step can be examined individually. To eliminate complications from all other known and unknown proteins, metabolites, and post-translational modifications that may contribute additional levels of regulation, we used a cell-free system composed of highly purified full-length recombinant proteins, without N- or C-terminal tags, and as a source of membranes either liposomes with mitochondria-like composition [16] or subcellular fractions containing mitochondria. As a representative activator protein, we used the caspase-8 cleavage product of Bid (tBid) to activate Bax. This protein drives Bax/Bak-dependent permeabilization of mitochondria [17,18] and also binds directly to antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 [19].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9238</offset><text>The large increase in fluorescence that accompanies the release of the fluorophore/quencher pair 8-aminonaphthalene 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS)/p-xylene-bis-pyridinium (DPX) from liposomes was used to measure Bax-dependent membrane permeabilization and its inhibition by Bcl-XL [7]. As seen previously, single addition of recombinant Bax (100 nM) or tBid (20 nM) to liposomes had little effect, but in combination the two proteins caused an increase in fluorescence due to membrane permeabilization (Figure 1A). This result is consistent with previous observations that tBid-activated Bax caused permeabilization of mitochondria in cells [19], isolated mitochondria [8,9], and liposomes [16].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>9933</offset><text>Bax and tBid Cooperate To Induce Liposome Permeabilization, Which Is Inhibited by Bcl-XL</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>10022</offset><text>(A) Liposomes encapsulated with ANTS and DPX were incubated with 100 nM Bax, 20 nM tBid, or both (left panel) or with 100 nM Bax, 20 nM tBid, and the indicated concentrations of Bcl-XL (right panel).

Without tBid, Bax (100 nM) did not bind to liposomes, as expected from results seen in vitro and in cells [20]. However, when the two proteins were added together, 20 nM tBid caused most of the Bax to bind liposomes. The stoichiometry of this interaction confirms that one tBid molecule can directly or indirectly recruit multiple Bax molecules to membranes [21]. The resulting membrane permeabilization released ANTS/DPX and larger encapsulated fluorophores (Figure S1A) as well as fluorescent proteins of similar mass to the proteins released from the intermembrane space of mitochondria during apoptosis (unpublished data).</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0071</infon><location offset="11451" length="136"/><text>In incubations of 20 nM tBid and liposomes, tBid bound effectively to liposomes as assayed by gel filtration chromatography (Figure 1B).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12215</offset><text>Addition of recombinant Bcl-XL inhibited tBid/Bax-mediated liposome permeabilization in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1A) with an IC50 of ∼25 nM at the 2 h end point.

At all effective concentrations of Bcl-XL, membrane binding by Bax was efficiently inhibited (Figures 1B and 3), as has been observed previously in cells [22] and for mitochondria [18]. While Bax membrane binding was inhibited, Bcl-XL had no effect on tBid binding to membranes (Figure 1B). These results argue that Bcl-XL inhibits membrane permeabilization by preventing the binding of Bax, but not tBid, to membranes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>12937</offset><text>Bcl-XL Binds Both tBid and Bax To Prevent Membrane Permeabilization</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13005</offset><text>(A) Liposomes encapsulated with ANTS and DPX were incubated with 100 nM Bax, 20 nM tBid or tBid-mt1, and increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL, Bcl-XL Y101K, or Bcl-XL ΔBH4.

Like liposomes, these mitochondria were resistant to tBid, as outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeabilization, measured by the release of cytochrome c, required the addition of both tBid and Bax (Figure 1C). As seen with liposomes, Bcl-XL inhibited tBid/Bax-mediated cytochrome c release. To assess the binding of recombinant Bax to mitochondria, the organelles were incubated with or without tBid or tBid and Bcl-XL, pelleted by centrifugation, and analyzed by immunoblotting (Figure 1D). The addition of tBid increased the level of membrane-bound Bax and caused the integration of Bax into the OMM, as assessed by resistance to carbonate extraction, while the addition of Bcl-XL inhibited these effects, confirming our results obtained with liposomes.

The stoichiometry of this interaction indicates that, similar to the effect on Bax, one tBid molecule recruits multiple Bcl-XL molecules. When MLM from bak –/– mice were used as the membrane source, the addition of tBid markedly increased the levels of membrane-integrated Bcl-XL.

This interaction was not dependent on the detergent used to solubilize the liposomes (unpublished data), and at concentrations of 100 nM Bcl-XL and 20 nM tBid the interaction was not affected by the addition of Bax (Figure 2A, left panel, lanes 1 and 2). In the absence of membranes, interaction between Bcl-XL and tBid could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data). Therefore, sequestering membrane-bound tBid represents one mechanism whereby Bcl-XL could inhibit apoptosis (Figure 6C, step 4). The recruitment of multiple Bcl-XL molecules by a single molecule of membrane-bound tBid increases the likelihood that tBid will be sequestered by Bcl-XL, thereby increasing how effectively Bcl-XL competes with Bax for tBid binding. Furthermore, when Bcl-XL prevented tBid/Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization (Figure 1A), Bcl-XL was overwhelmingly membrane-bound (Figure 1B). Thus, contrary to models that propose that membrane integration would inactivate Bcl-XL [25], our results suggest that tBid is required to cause a conformational change in Bcl-XL that allows it to insert into membranes where it may inhibit tBid (Figure 6B).</text><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="17472" length="102"/><text>When both proteins were in the membranes, Bcl-XL bound to tBid, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation.</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="17830" length="132"/><text>In the absence of membranes, interaction between Bcl-XL and tBid could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>18729</offset><text>Bcl-XL Binds to Membrane-Bound tBid and Bax</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>18773</offset><text>(A) Bax (100 nM) and/or tBid (20 nm) were incubated with 100 nM Bcl-XL (left panel) or 20 nM Bcl-XL (right panels) and liposomes.

Consistent with this previous report, in our assay system tBid-mt1efficiently recruited Bax to membranes where Bax was activated (unpublished data), but tBid-mt1 did not coprecipitate with Bcl-XL (Figure 2B). Thus, tBid-mt1 allows the selective removal of the Bcl-XL–tBid interaction. Conversely, a mutation within the BH3 binding pocket of Bcl-XL (Y101K) prevents stable binding to Bax [28]. As expected, Bcl-XL Y101K bound tBid but did not bind to activated Bax (Figure 2C), even in the presence of NP-40 detergent. Therefore, using Bcl-XL Y101K allows the selective removal of Bcl-XL–Bax binding. Combining these two mutants creates a situation where Bcl-XL does not bind stably to either tBid or Bax (unpublished data). As a negative control, we used Bcl-XL with a deletion of the BH4 domain (amino acids 4–24) that has been reported to remove binding to both Bax and the BH3-only protein Bad [29]. In our assay, ΔBH4 Bcl-XL did not coprecipitate tBid and bound very inefficiently to activated Bax (Figure 2D). Addition of the Y101K point mutation to ΔBH4 Bcl-XL to further remove Bax binding did not reduce this residual interaction (unpublished data), indicating that it is nonspecific. Therefore, these mutants behave similarly in live cells and in our cell-free system.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24994</offset><text>By assay of ANTS/DPX release from liposomes for different combinations of these proteins, the residual function of Bcl-XL can be measured in the absence of stable interaction with tBid, Bax, or both.

When tBid was replaced by tBid-mt1, Bcl-XL continued to inhibit membrane permeabilization and bound Bax activated by tBid-mt1 (Figure 2B).

Nevertheless, the protein offered significant protection from tBid/Bax-induced dye release from liposomes. Thus, the loss of tBid or Bax binding to Bcl-XL can be compensated by the other binding interaction. The combination of tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K or ΔBH4 Bcl-XL (situations in which Bcl-XL binds stably to neither tBid nor Bax) greatly reduced the activity of Bcl-XL but did not eliminate it completely. To address the possibility that this remaining activity was the result of residual Bcl-XL–tBid or Bcl-XL–Bax interactions at elevated concentrations of Bcl-XL, we examined the effects of the tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K mutations on Bcl-XL–tBid and Bcl-XL–Bax interactions by co-immonoprecipitation at Bcl-XL concentrations higher than those shown in Figure 2 (Figure S2). To detect the interactions of Bcl-XL with tBid-mt1 as well as Bcl-XL Y101K with Bax required elevated concentrations of Bcl-XL and/or prolonged immunoblot exposures compared to the wild-type proteins, suggesting that these residual interactions either are nonspecific or contribute very little to the remaining antiapoptotic activity seen with the tBid-mt1/Bcl-XL Y101K combination. To test this possibility further, we combined the tBid-mt1/Bcl-XL Y101K and ΔBH4 Bcl-XL mutations. This combination of mutations (tBid-mt1 with ΔBH4 Bcl-XL Y101K) did not further diminish Bcl-XL function (unpublished data), suggesting that this remaining activity does not involve stable protein–protein interactions.

By the use of bak –/– MLM (Figure 3B, quantified in Figure 3C), Bcl-XL inhibited tBid/Bax-induced membrane permeabilization in a dose-dependent manner, as was seen in liposomes. Substitution of tBid-mt1 or Bcl-XL Y101K for the respective wild-type proteins only slightly reduced the prevention of cytochrome c release by Bcl-XL. Using these two mutants together markedly reduced but did not eliminate the inhibition of cytochrome c release by Bcl-XL, similar to the residual activity noted with liposome permeabilization. When wild-type MLM that contained BAK were used, it was necessary to reduce the concentration of tBid 10-fold to 25 pM to prevent it from activating sufficient Bak to cause OMM permeabilization. At this concentration of tBid, cytochrome c release required the addition of Bax (unpublished data), and the activity of Bcl-XL was similar to that seen with bak –/– MLM (Figure 3D). In these incubations, substitution of the wild-type proteins with tBid-mt1, Bcl-XL Y101K, or both showed similar effects to those seen in bak –/– MLM and liposomes (Figure 3C). Thus, in contrast to widely promulgated models for the antiapoptotic mechanism of Bcl-XL, our results with purified proteins in the presence of relevant membrane targets indicate that Bcl-XL binding to Bax and tBid are both functionally relevant, but neither is paramount.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28894</offset><text>Membrane-Bound Bcl-XL Inhibits Bax Binding to Membranes Via Multiple Mechanisms</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28974</offset><text>Although our results indicate that Bcl-XL inhibits tBid-mediated activation of Bax by sequestering tBid in a stable complex, it is unclear how Bcl-XL inhibits Bax binding to membranes.

Therefore, in the absence of Bcl-XL/tBid heterodimerization, Bcl-XL may inhibit recruitment of Bax by binding to membrane-bound Bax and inhibiting Bax autoactivation. To address this possibility, we substituted Bcl-XL with the Bax-binding-deficient Bcl-XL Y101K and assayed Bax binding to liposomes in the presence of tBid-mt1 (Figure 4A, lanes 9–12).

Because the membrane appears to be the active locus, we used the mutant versions of Bcl-XL and tBid to examine the importance of stable binding to tBid or Bax for Bcl-XL to bind tightly to membranes (Figure 4B). In a negative control experiment without other added proteins, less than 10 nM of the added Bcl-XL (100 nM) bound to membranes (Figure 4B, lane 1). Addition of Bax to the incubation did not increase membrane binding by Bcl-XL (lane 2). As noted above (Figure 1B), a substoichiometric amount of tBid (lane 3) caused ∼80 nM Bcl-XL to bind to membranes, suggesting that each tBid molecule recruited three to four Bcl-XL molecules. Membrane binding by Bcl-XL was reduced greatly when tBid was substituted by tBid-mt1, indicating that stable Bcl-XL–tBid binding can recruit Bcl-XL (lane 5). However, the addition of Bax and tBid-mt1 (lane 6) caused the near complete recruitment of Bcl-XL (∼85 nM membrane-bound). Under these conditions, the concentration of membrane-bound, activated Bax is only ∼15 nM (Figure 4A, lane 8), yet the concentration of membrane-bound Bcl-XL increases by ∼60 nM above that seen with tBid-mt1, indicating that similar to tBid each activated Bax molecule recruits about four Bcl-XL molecules. Thus, like tBid, tBid-activated Bax recruits both soluble Bax and Bcl-XL. Surprisingly, when both soluble Bax and Bcl-XL are present, it appears that activated Bax recruits Bcl-XL more efficiently than it recruits Bax. Therefore, another way that Bcl-XL inhibits recruitment of Bax is by competing with it for activated Bax on the membrane.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33894</offset><text>The Bax-binding-deficient mutant Bcl-XL Y101K directly and efficiently binds liposomes (Figure 4B, lanes 7–9).

Consistent with a role for membrane binding, removing the C-terminal tail that mediates membrane binding impaired but did not abolish Bcl-XL function (Figure S4), similar to the results obtained in cells using the same mutant [37]. However, removal of the C-terminal tail in the context of the tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K mutations completely abolishes the remaining activity of Bcl-XL. It is possible therefore that the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL that is independent of stable interactions with tBid and Bax requires that Bcl-XL is membrane-bound.

Binding of 6A7 has been used widely as a marker for one of the stages required for activation of Bax (reviewed in [10]). In vivo, this conformational change has been observed for membrane-bound Bax actively involved in membrane permeabilization [38,39]. However, in experiments using liposomes, it is evident that the exposure of this epitope occurs prior to and is independent of Bax membrane insertion. The change is presumed to result from an interaction of Bax with the surface of the membrane because it rapidly reverses when Bax is separated from the liposomes [7]. This liposome-induced conformational change does not require tBid; however, the epitope remains exposed after tBid-induced Bax membrane insertion (Figure 5A, lanes 1 and 2).

Thus, for most functions Bcl-XL behaves in a manner conceptually similar to a dominant-negative Bax. Bcl-XL inhibited membrane binding by Bax by competing with soluble Bax for recruitment to membranes by either tBid or membrane-bound Bax (Figure 6). Thus, similar to Bax, Bcl-XL binds to both activated, membrane-bound Bax and membrane-bound tBid. Furthermore, Bcl-XL binding to Bax inhibits the subsequent oligomerization of membrane-bound Bax.

However, as these experiments were conducted on whole cells where Bax was also present, it is possible that the lack of function of this mutant is caused by the loss of binding to both BH3-only proteins (e.g., tBid) and Bax , a result entirely consistent with our observations. Conversely, early work with the M97A/D98A Bid mutant that does not bind to Bcl-XL [27,30] that we have used in our study (tBid mt1) indicated that Bcl-XL inhibited the apoptosis caused by this Bid mutant, in cells and in purified mitochondria, implying that the interaction with activated Bax rather than Bid was critical to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL in this context. Our model reconciles these disparate results by postulating that only after loss of both interactions does the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL become severely diminished. While Bcl-XL may inhibit OMM permeabilization initiated by the BH3-only proteins Bid, Bim, and Puma by sequestering these proteins, a variety of evidence now exists for alternate Bax activation pathways (reviewed in [10]) that do not rely on these BH3-only proteins. For many of these known and potentially unknown pathways, Bcl-XL may not directly sequester the initial activators of Bax, and hence inhibition of membrane permeabilization may rely on the sequestration of activated Bax to inhibit Bax autoactivation, oligomerization, and membrane permeabilization.</text><annotation id="21"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="44478" length="299"/><text>Pioneering experiments to identify relevant binding partners for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL using immunoprecipitation in transfected cells suggested a lack of correlation between Bax binding and inhibition of apoptosis, as only certain Bcl-XL point mutants that could no longer bind to Bax lost function [40].</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46504</offset><text>Our results clearly show that the major functional interactions of Bcl-XL occur after the protein has migrated to the membrane, a process initiated in our in vitro system by binding to either membrane-localized tBid or membrane-localized (activated) Bax. Membrane insertion of both tBid [41] and Bax [42] exposes the proapoptotic BH3 region of each protein, an event that is critical for interaction with Bcl-XL and likely initiates a conformational change in the antiapoptotic protein that is required for membrane insertion. Bcl-XL is found in both the cytoplasm as well as attached to (but not inserted into) the mitochondrial membrane in healthy cells. Migration of the cytoplasmic fraction to membranes with insertion occurs during apoptosis [23,43,44] for Bcl-XL as well as other antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 [44] and Bcl-w [25,45]. For Bcl-w, interaction with a tethered Bim BH3 peptide displaces the C-terminal insertion sequence from the BH3 binding pocket within the protein triggering insertion of the protein into the membrane [25,46]. Although a structure has not been reported for Bcl-XL containing the C-terminal insertion sequence, the structure of the truncated protein is sufficiently similar to that of Bcl-w [46] and proapoptotic Bax [36] to suggest displacement of the insertion sequence of Bcl-XL as a mechanism that drives Bcl-XL into the membrane. In vitro binding assays using protein lacking the C-terminal insertion sequence have shown that Bcl-XL binds a variety of BH3 peptides [2,34]. For several of the peptides, structural studies have confirmed that the peptides bind in the hydrophobic pocket that is also believed to bind the Bcl-XL insertion sequence [47–49]. Furthermore, it has been reported previously that overexpression of Bad caused the membrane insertion of Bcl-XL in HeLa cells [33]. We therefore determined whether peptides from the BH3 regions of Bid, Bim, Bad, Bax, and Bak caused insertion of Bcl-XL into liposomes, assayed by flotation on a sucrose gradient (Figure S6). All five peptides caused Bcl-XL to insert into membranes, while a mutant Bid peptide that fails to bind Bcl-XL [2] did not.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48658</offset><text>In cells, it is likely that other BH3-only proteins will substitute in many cases for tBid, and unlike Bid some of these proteins may not be required themselves to bind to membranes to expose the BH3 sequence. Nevertheless, whether initiated in the cytoplasm or at the surface of the membrane, interaction of Bcl-XL with a proapoptotic BH3 sequence is likely to be at least one of the factors that contributes to the insertion of Bcl-XL into membranes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49111</offset><text>Previous reports using transfected cells have indicated that the removal of the C-terminal insertion sequence of Bcl-XL severely impairs membrane insertion but has varying effects on Bcl-XL function, from moderate [29] to severe [50] reduction in function. Consistent with this variability, we have shown previously [37] that the function of ΔTM Bcl-XL compared to that of wild type is heavily dependent on the stimulus used to initiate apoptosis (and therefore possibly the BH3 protein(s) involved). In our in vitro system, ΔTM Bcl-XL showed a severe loss of function (Figure S3) as the relevant interactions here occur on membranes. However, in certain circumstances in cells ΔTM Bcl-XL may retain at least part of its antiapoptotic function in the cytoplasm depending on the location of relevant binding partners at the onset of apoptosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49957</offset><text>While we have focused our experiments on examining tBid and its interactions with Bax and Bcl-XL, our studies do not imply that tBid is an essential component of the membrane permeabilization process. Instead, we predict that various aspects of the functions of Bcl-XL and Bax revealed here can be triggered differentially by the different BH3 proteins that have been identified. Moreover, different BH3-only proteins would be expected to exhibit differences in the relative affinities for and activities on Bax and Bcl-XL, as we have described in our “embedded together” model [10]. However, the previously reported binding affinities between BH3 peptides and other Bcl-2 family members are unlikely to accurately reflect binding affinities at the physiologically relevant locus of membranes. Clearly, it will be important to determine more appropriate quantitative estimates for the interactions of Bcl-2 family proteins in membranes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50898</offset><text>Inhibition of the transient conformation change in Bax that occurs at the membrane surface (Figure 6D) is the only step in which inhibition of Bax activation is not due to Bcl-XL functioning similar to a defective version of Bax. It is likely that the conformational change in Bax at the membrane surface enhances its activation by membrane-bound tBid. Consistent with this interpretation, tethering of the soluble Bid BH3 peptide to liposomes increased its potency by several orders of magnitude [51]. It is not known how membrane-bound Bcl-XL prevents a transient change in the conformation of Bax. However, it is not unreasonable to speculate that it might do so by interacting transiently with Bax to shift the equilibrium in Bax conformers sufficiently toward the 6A7-negative conformation that the antibody does not have sufficient access to the epitope to bind it.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51770</offset><text>Our in vitro system recapitulates the core features of organelle permeabilization by activated Bax and its inhibition by Bcl-XL and has allowed us to identify and examine many of the individual steps. The liposomes that we used to model physiologic membranes have a high intrinsic curvature and lipid composition that facilitate membrane binding of the recombinant proteins and induction of the 6A7 conformational change in Bax. In cells, these feature are likely represented by complex and dynamic physiologic processes such as mitochondrial membrane fission and fusion shown to be important in apoptosis [52–54] and the interaction of mitochondria with other membrane systems [39,52,55]. The major observations reported here were confirmed for cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Figure 3B–D), suggesting that they will be relevant in live cells. Moreover, the simplicity and power of our in vitro system using recombinant proteins and membranes has allowed us to identify and measure functionally important and potentially “druggable” interactions important for the regulation of apoptosis (Figure 6).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>52887</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>52909</offset><text>Materials.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52920</offset><text>The bak –/– mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.
