We report for the first time an association between integrins and Rab proteins, which are small GTPases involved in the traffic of endocytotic vesicles. Rab21 (and Rab5) associate with the cytoplasmic domains of α-integrin chains, and their expression influences the endo/exocytic traffic of integrins. This function of Rab21 is dependent on its GTP/GDP cycle and proper membrane targeting. Knock down of Rab21 impairs integrin-mediated cell adhesion and motility, whereas its overexpression stimulates cell migration and cancer cell adhesion to collagen and human bone. Finally, overexpression of Rab21 fails to induce cell adhesion via an integrin point mutant deficient in Rab21 association. These data provide mechanistic insight into how integrins are targeted to intracellular compartments and how their traffic regulates cell adhesion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1047</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1060</offset><text>Cell adhesion and migration are pivotal to many biological and pathological processes, including development, inflammation, repair, and cancer metastasis. The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is very complex. It requires the coordination of adhesion receptor–matrix interactions on the cell surface, trafficking of the receptors to and from the sites of adhesion (adhesion site turnover), and cytoskeletal reorganization inside the cell. Moreover, all these events have to be precisely orchestrated not only spatially but also temporally.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1609</offset><text>α/β-Integrin heterodimers are key molecules involved in cell adhesion and migration. Binding of cell surface–expressed integrins to specific ligands on the extracellular matrix is relatively well understood (Hynes, 2002). In contrast, much less is known about the turnover of integrin-containing adhesion sites and the intracellular traffic of integrins, although their importance in cell adhesion and migration is being increasingly recognized (Bretscher, 1996; Huttenlocher, 2005). In particular, the mechanisms that target integrins to specific endocytic compartments remain unknown.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2200</offset><text>Eukaryotic cells internalize cell-surface receptors by endocytosis. Integrins, like several other proteins lacking the AP-2 localization signal are internalized from the cell membrane via nonclathrin-derived structures, and some integrins have been shown to subsequently fuse with compartments containing clathrin-derived cargo proteins (Ng et al., 1999; Naslavsky et al., 2003; Upla et al., 2004; Weigert et al., 2004). The endocytosed receptors are subsequently recycled back to the cell surface or targeted for degradation. Depending on the cell type and the stimulus, integrins have been shown to be transported through caveolin-1–positive structures or early endosomes, either directly or via the perinuclear recycling compartment, back to the plasma membrane (Caswell and Norman, 2006).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2995</offset><text>Rab proteins are small GTPases that regulate both endocytosis and exocytosis. Several members have been implicated to function on the endocytic pathway, in which the function of Rab5 is understood in more detail (Miaczynska and Zerial, 2002). Rab5 regulates membrane traffic into and between early endosomes as well as vesicle transport along microtubules (Zerial and McBride, 2001).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3379</offset><text>Integrin traffic is regulated by several kinases (Ng et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Ivaska et al., 2002; Woods et al., 2004) and motor proteins (Zhang et al., 2004). However, very little is known about the mechanisms that target integrins to specific intracellular compartments and how this may be controlled. Although Rab proteins are known to bind a multiplicity of diverse effectors (Zerial and McBride, 2001), only a few examples demonstrate an interaction between a Rab GTPase and a cargo molecule (Seachrist et al., 2002; van IJzendoorn et al., 2002). We identify Rab21 and Rab5 as integrin-associated proteins and positive regulators of integrin traffic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4058</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4066</offset><text>Identification of β1-integrins as Rab21-associated molecules</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4128</offset><text>To identify novel integrin-interacting proteins, we screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library using α2-integrin cytoplasmic domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen.

GFP-tagged Rab21 coprecipitated with α2β1-integrin, a collagen binding molecule (Takada and Hemler, 1989), in cells plated either on collagen or on plastic (Fig. 1 A), indicating a constant, rather than a matrix adhesion–inducible, association between the two proteins. Furthermore, Rab21 was found to associate with several α/β1-integrin heterodimers. Rab21 coprecipitated with chimeric integrins containing the extracellular domain of α2-integrin fused to the cytoplasmic domains of either α1- or α5-integrin (Fig. 1 B) and endogenous integrins that were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against α1, α2, α5, α6, and β1 subunits (Fig. 1, B and C; and Table S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1). These data suggest that the association involves the shared conserved membrane-proximal segment present in most α-subunit cytoplasmic domains. To get evidence for the association with an independent method, we performed yeast two-hybrid studies with α-tail mutants. In remating tests, we found that the COOH-terminal part of Rab21 (amino acids 95–222) was able to associate with the cytoplasmic tails of α2- and α11-integrin (Fig. 1 D). Introduction of a proline residue adjacent to the conserved membrane-proximal sequence (α2P, to create a conformational change into the α2 tail) markedly weakened the association between the α2 cytoplasmic domain and Rab21, whereas mutagenesis of a conserved positive charge in α2A (K1160) and α11A (R1170) tails had no effect (Fig. 1 D). To further characterize the Rab21–integrin association, we generated several mutants of α2-integrin. All of these mutants were expressed and mediated adhesion to collagen in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1 E and not depicted; see Fig. 6 E). Mutagenesis of residue R1161 (in α2AA and α2AAKYA, removing another conserved charged residue) to alanine significantly reduced α2 tail association with Rab21 judged by yeast mating tests and immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, F1159A mutation (α2AARA, possibly creating a conformational change) showed reduced association in the yeast assays, whereas in immunoprecipitations the reduction was not significant. These data on the mutant integrins suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain and residue R1161 of α2-integrin are important for the Rab21 association. Finally, endogenous β1-integrins readily associated with endogenous Rab21 and to some extent Rab5 proteins in vivo. These associations were specific, as Rab7 and Rab11 failed to coprecipitate β1-integrin from these cells, even though separately all proteins were efficiently immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 F).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7450</offset><text>Rab21 associates with cytoplasmic domains of α-integrin subunits.

In addition, these cells also harbor large endogenous EEA1-positive endosomes that stained positive for Rab5A but showed very limited overlap with Rab21 (Fig. 1 G, arrows). α/β1- Integrin heterodimers can be expressed in active (extracellular domain detected by a monoclonal antibody HUTS21; active-β1 antibody) and inactive forms on the cell surface (extracellular domain of both forms detected by P5D2; pan-β1 antibody; Lenter et al., 1993; Luque et al., 1996). Expression of Rab21 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells altered the subcellular localization of the total pool of β1-integrins. Cells expressing GFP-Rab21 contained numerous β1-integrin−positive vesicles (compare the nontransfected cell [Fig. 2 A, asterisk] and the transfected cell [Fig. 2 B]). The majority of these had GFP-Rab21 on their limiting membrane (72 ± 8% of pan-β1–positive vesicles and 68 ± 10% of active-β1–positive vesicles; n = 20 cells; Fig. 2, B and C). The recruitment of integrins to Rab21-positive intracellular structures was confirmed using two additional antibodies recognizing active-β1-integrin (12G10 [Mould et al., 1995] and P4G11 [Wayner et al., 1993]; Fig. 2, J and K). Similar to previous observations on breast cancer cells (Ng et al., 1999), the ECM proteins collagen and fibronectin were also detected in the endocytic structures (Fig. 2 L and not depicted). Interestingly, both Rab21 mutants induced marked alterations in the cellular distribution of β1-integrins. GFP-Rab21GTP showed a tubular- vesicular staining pattern that largely overlaps with the ER (Fig. 2, D and E; and not depicted), and active-β1-integrin was detected in smaller and more irregularly shaped endocytotic integrin vesicles, whereas the pan-β1 antibody detected β1-integrin at the membrane, diffusely in the cytosol and accumulated in the large vacuolar structures. Strikingly, expression of GFP-Rab21GDP induced localization of active-β1 into large focal adhesions (Fig. 2 F, arrows), which are rarely detected in these highly motile cells endogenously (Fig. 2 A). GFP-Rab21GDP variant but not GFP-Rab21GTP was also seen at membrane ruffles (Fig. 2 G, arrows).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12772</offset><text>Rab21 influences the subcellular distribution and traffic of β1-integrins.

After 15 min of internalization, Rab5/21, but not Rab7, associated with biotinylated plasma membrane–derived ∼160-kD protein (Fig. 3 A, internalization 15 min, lanes 1 and 2). Reimmunoprecipitation revealed that β1-integrin was present, possibly with other plasma membrane–derived proteins, in the biotinylated Rab5/21 coprecipitating fraction (Fig. 3 A, internalization 15 min, lane 3), indicating that integrins associate with Rabs mainly after internalization. Further colocalization and internalization studies showed that internalized β1-integrins originally traverse through the same compartment as transferrin but, subsequently, the integrin traffics into separate, mainly GFP-Rab21–positive vesicles that can also contain caveolin, whereas transferrin remains colocalized extensively with GFP-Rab5 (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1).

GFP-Rab21 but not -Rab11 induced integrin internalization as well (74–86% after 10 min). Importantly, transferrin endocytosis was unaltered by Rab21 expression, suggesting that Rab21 does not influence the traffic of endosomally translocated receptors in general (Fig. S2 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1). We are aware that we have not excluded the effects of Rab21 expression for all types of unspecific internalization (e.g., macropinocytosis), but at least its closest homologues (Rab5 and Rab22) have not been shown to affect macropinocytosis (Rosenfeld et al., 2001; Kauppi et al., 2002). Interestingly, the internalized receptor recycled rapidly back to the cell surface in Rab5- and Rab21-expressing cells with >50% of the labeled pool being recycled during a 15-min chase (detected by the reduction in the amount of biotinylated receptor in these cells where cell surface biotin is cleaved). Integrin internalization was reduced by expression of GFP-Rab21GDP, whereas GFP-Rab21GTP induced a steady accumulation of the internalized receptor when compared with GFP-, Rab5-, Rab11-, and Rab21GDP-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B, 30-min chase).

GFP-Rab21 was detected in large, swollen endosome-resembling structures, as well as in motile, smaller vesicles, which moved bidirectionally between the cytosol and the cell edges at velocity ranging from 0.75–2.25 μm/s (Fig. 4 A, vesicles B and C; and Video 1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1). Small vesicles were observed interacting with each other and associating with bright Rab21-containing domains on the larger Rab21-positive structures (Fig. 4 A, vesicle A) identical to the β1-integrin–containing vesicles seen in our immunofluorescence stainings (Figs. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1). The short-range motion of the Rab21 vesicles at the cell periphery was sensitive to the disruption of actin filaments with 20 μM cytochalasin (unpublished data), and the long-range curvilinear movements observed in the cell body were abolished upon treatment with 5 μM nocodazole (unpublished data), suggesting a role for actin and microtubules. Combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; pseudocolored green) and conventional widefield epifluorescence analysis (pseudocolored red) showed GFP-Rab21 vesicles emanating from the membrane into the cell (changing from green to red/yellow) and back or vice versa (although formally this technique does not exclude the possibility that some vesicles will by chance come closer and further away from the plasma membrane). The intensity plots show rapid changes in the intensities of the signal in the green channel, whereas the signal in the red channel remains constant (Fig. 4 B and Video 2). No obvious diffusion of the bright Rab21 structures was seen using TIRFM, indicating either that the Rab21-labeled structures remain as distinct domains on the plasma membrane or that they do not fuse with the membrane. This former possibility correlates well with the observation that upon binding the small vesicles seem to remain as bright patches on the limiting membranes of the intracellular large Rab21-positive structures (Fig. 4 A). Real-time imaging and TIRFM confirmed that the intact GTP/GDP cycling of Rab21 was crucial for its vesicular traffic because motile small vesicles were not detected in GFP-Rab21GDP–transfected cells and Rab21 was associated with rather static structures at the cell membrane (Fig. 4 C and Video 3). These resemble YFP-talin–positive structures detected by TIRFM (Fig. 4 D) and may represent adhesion structures that have reduced turnover because of the expression of GFP- Rab21GDP and possibly its association with β1-integrin.</text><annotation id="7"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="21623" length="443"/><text>Combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; pseudocolored green) and conventional widefield epifluorescence analysis (pseudocolored red) showed GFP-Rab21 vesicles emanating from the membrane into the cell (changing from green to red/yellow) and back or vice versa (although formally this technique does not exclude the possibility that some vesicles will by chance come closer and further away from the plasma membrane).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>23223</offset><text>GFP-Rab21 displays bidirectional movement between the plasma membrane and the cell body.

Of all the Rabs tested, overexpressed Rab21 was most efficient in increasing cell adhesion to collagen (86 ± 8% in PC3 cells and 22% in MDA-MB-231 cells; Fig. 6, A and B) during the initial 30 min of adhesion. Rab21 expression did not enhance the initial adhesion step of cells plated on fibronectin or vitronectin (Fig. S2 B). Expression of Rab5 increased adhesion by 48 ± 13% in PC3 cells. The GTP/GDP cycling of Rab21 was found to be important for supporting integrin function because the Rab21 mutants were unable to induce cell adhesion to collagen (Fig. 6 B). The lack of dominant effects of the mutants is probably due to the fact that their ectopic expression is not sufficient to interfere with the high number of endogenous associations between integrins and Rabs involved in regulating adhesion/migration, whereas introduction of Rab21WT supports adhesion to collagen by further increasing the endosomal traffic of α/β1-integrin heterodimers. Overexpression of GFP-Rab5, -Rab11, -Rab21, or -Rab21GTP did not influence the amount of β1-integrin detected on the surface of MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 6 C) and PC3 cells (not depicted), suggesting that efficient transport of endocytosed integrins to newly formed sites of adhesion, rather than a change in the steady-state expression of integrins on the cell surface, is the basis of Rab21-induced cell adhesion. Interestingly, GFP-Rab21GDP caused a modest increase in β1-integrin surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6 C). Thus, Rab21GDP both inhibits integrin traffic and increases cell surface levels of integrins. This induction of two counteracting forces further explains the lack of dominant-negative effects on adhesion. Most important, specific silencing of Rab21 with two different RNAi oligos (Fig. 6 D) resulted in a 30% reduction in the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to collagen. As no down-regulation of β1-integrin was observed, the effect of Rab21 knockdown is most likely due to inefficient integrin traffic. Finally, to demonstrate that Rab21–integrin association is involved in Rab21-induced cell adhesion, we used the mutant α2-integrins with reduced Rab21 binding (Fig. 1, D and E). CHO cells lack endogenous collagen receptors. Transient expression of α2WT, α2AA (deficient Rab21 association), or α2A (unaltered Rab21 association), together with Rluc, enabled equivalent adhesion of these cells to collagen (Fig. 6 E, bottom). Rluc-Rab21 induced adhesion to collagen when coexpressed with α2WT- or α2A-integrins but failed to do so with α2AA-integrin mutant (Fig. 6 E, top). Furthermore, coexpression of Rluc-Rab21 induced vesicular localization of GFP-α2WT but had no effect on the cellular distribution of GFP-α2AA (Fig. 6 F).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>29372</offset><text>Rab21 influences cell adhesion and migration.

The identification of integrin association with the putative early endosomal Rab21 led us to identify a functional relationship between integrin association with Rab21 and Rab5 and the regulation of cell adhesion. Several studies have demonstrated integrin endocytosis into intracellular vesicles and their recycling back to the membrane (Bretscher, 1989, 1992). In serum-starved cells stably adhering to tissue culture plastic, integrins have been shown to be transported to a perinuclear recycling compartment. Upon growth factor stimulus, internalized integrins either recycle very rapidly back to the plasma membrane from the perinuclear compartment (β1-integrins; Powelka et al., 2004) or are completely rerouted to a short-loop trafficking pathway directly back to the membrane (αvβ3-integrin; Roberts et al., 2004). The existence of a Rab–integrin association, which positively regulates cell adhesion, provides a missing mechanistic link into the orchestration of this complex process. We show on one hand that the motility of Rab21 vesicles close to the plasma membrane requires the actin cytoskeleton and, on the other hand, that expression of Rab21 mutants with impaired GTP binding or membrane localization induce integrin targeting to the membrane and the formation of exaggerated adhesion sites. This is in agreement with the recent finding that integrins in newly forming protrusions travel on actin cables associated to motor protein Myosin X and that normal cell adhesion and spreading during the initial stages of adhesion seem to require the efficient motility of integrins close to the plasma membrane (Zhang et al., 2004).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35720</offset><text>There is only limited data available on the dynamics of integrins in cells. One study demonstrates the internalization of GFP-tagged integrin in live cells (Laukaitis et al., 2001). However, no integrin movements back to the plasma membrane were seen. Although the role of Rab proteins was not addressed in the study of Laukaitis et al. (2001), it is intriguing to note that the large vesicles they described are remarkably similar to the structures induced here by the overexpression of GFP-Rab21. We show here that these large structures resemble MVBs. MVBs are generally thought of as being major protein sorting stations in the endocytic pathway. Proteins at their limiting membrane can be packaged into transport vesicles destined to the cell surface or to the TGN. Alternatively, proteins can be targeted to inwardly budding vesicles of the MVBs. These latter are considered to be the exosomes secreted after fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane (Fevrier and Raposo, 2004). The observation that overexpressed GFP-Rab21 is seen mainly in the limiting membrane and vesicles surrounding the MVBs points to an involvement of the MVBs in recycling vesicles back to the plasma membrane. The enlargement of the MVBs and accumulation of the vesicles most likely is the result of overexpression of the Rab21 protein, indicating its role in traffic to the MVBs. Our data does not unambiguously show whether integrins and Rabs interact directly. The facts that the association was detected from a yeast two-hybrid screen and that it is abrogated by mutagenesis of the α-cytoplasmic domain suggest that it may be direct. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that as-yet-unknown proteins that are capable of binding to the integrin may serve as linkers between Rab21 and integrins. We were unable to detect direct interaction of GST-Rab21 with synthetic integrin cytoplasmic tail peptides. However, this does not necessarily mean that the interaction is not direct. It is possible that the peptides are not presented in a correct conformation for the interaction to occur. Evidence from detailed biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Stefansson et al., 2004; Vinogradova et al., 2004) indicates that upon integrin activation the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails move out of the membrane into the cytoplasm, revealing the highly conserved residues to the cytoplasmic face and involving substantial structural changes in the cytoplasmic tails. We show that Rab21–integrin association occurs downstream of the internalization step and that a substantial portion of the internalized integrin is in an active conformation as detected by the activation epitope–specific antibodies. This is in line with our data showing that the association is mediated via the membrane proximal–conserved segment of the α-subunit COOH terminus, with conserved residue R1161 being especially important, and that the association seems to be α-tail conformation sensitive.</text><annotation id="13"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0077</infon><location offset="37796" length="409"/><text>Evidence from detailed biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Stefansson et al., 2004; Vinogradova et al., 2004) indicates that upon integrin activation the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails move out of the membrane into the cytoplasm, revealing the highly conserved residues to the cytoplasmic face and involving substantial structural changes in the cytoplasmic tails.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38721</offset><text>Prenylation-dependent membrane targeting of Rabs is crucial for Rab function as regulators of vesicle fusion in intracellular protein trafficking (Desnoyers et al., 1996).

Integrins have been shown to internalize in a dynamin and PKCα-dependent manner after ligand binding (Ng et al., 1999). Internalized β1-integrins are then targeted to caveosomes (Upla et al., 2004) or transferrin-positive endosomes (Laukaitis et al., 2001) depending on the heterodimer, the cell type, and the stimulus used. Recent data showing that the caveolar and endosomal pathways intersect (Pelkmans et al., 2004) and our data showing caveolin-1–positive domains on Rab5- and Rab21-positive integrin–containing vesicles provide a possible explanation for these variable integrin trafficking routes.
