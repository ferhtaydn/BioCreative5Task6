They are the small 10-kDa cytosolic acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), membrane-associated ACBP1 and ACBP2, extracellularly-targeted ACBP3, and kelch-motif containing ACBP4 and ACBP5. Here, the interaction of ACBP4 with an A. thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The subcellular localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion. Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis. Immuno-electron microscopy on Arabidopsis sections not only localized ACBP4 to the cytosol but also to the periphery of the nucleus upon closer examination, perhaps as a result of its interaction with AtEBP. Furthermore, the expression of ACBP4 and AtEBP in Northern blot analyses was induced by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, methyl jasmonate treatments, and Botrytis cinerea infection, suggesting that the interaction of ACBP4 and AtEBP may be related to AtEBP-mediated defence possibly via ethylene and/or jasmonate signalling.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="439" length="143"/><text>thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation.</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="439" length="143"/><text>thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation.</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="583" length="166"/><text>The subcellular localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion.</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="750" length="243"/><text>Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis.</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0663</infon><location offset="750" length="243"/><text>Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1556</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1569</offset><text>In Arabidopsis, six genes encode proteins that contain a conserved acyl-CoA-binding domain (Leung et al., 2004). They are the 10-kDa ACBP6 (Engeseth et al., 1996; Xiao et al., 2008), of which homologues are prevalent in eukaryotes, and larger ACBPs (ACBP1 to ACBP5), of which homologues have not been well-investigated in other organisms. Some of the larger ACBPs contain ankyrin repeats (ACBP1 and ACBP2), and kelch motifs (ACBP4 and ACBP5) that can potentially interact with protein partners (Li and Chye, 2003, 2004; Leung et al., 2004). ACBP2 has been previously shown to interact with AtEBP (Li and Chye, 2004). Our observations that various members of the Arabidopsis ACBP gene family consist of additional structural domains other than the conserved acyl-CoA-binding domain, plus their varying affinities for acyl-CoA esters, imply that they do not have redundant roles in plant lipid metabolism (Chye, 1998; Chye et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2004, 2006).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2531</offset><text>The acyl-CoA-binding domain in each ACBP has been shown to bind acyl-CoA esters, hence these ACBPs may mediate the subcellular transfer of acyl-CoA esters in plant lipid metabolism (Chye et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2004, 2006). Membrane-associated ACBP1 and ACBP2 could possibly maintain an acyl-CoA pool at the plasma membrane and participate in membrane biogenesis (Chye, 1998; Chye et al., 1999, 2000; Li and Chye, 2003; Xiao et al., 2008). We have also shown that transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ACBP1 showed enhanced tolerance to Pb(II)-induced stress, implying that ACBP1 could be involved in lipid bilayer membrane repair at the plasma membrane in response to Pb(II) stress (Xiao et al., 2008). ACBP3 has been demonstrated to be extracellularly-targeted (Leung et al., 2006) while ACBP4 and ACBP5 are predicted to be localized to the cytosol (Leung et al., 2004, 2006). The preference of ACBP4 and ACBP5 in oleoyl-CoA binding suggests that they could participate in the transfer of oleoyl-CoA esters to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the chloroplasts, in which de novo fatty acid biosynthesis occurs (Leung et al., 2004).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3671</offset><text>To elucidate the function of ACBP4, the significance of its acyl-CoA-binding domain has been addressed by using site-directed mutagenesis (Leung et al., 2004). The role of its kelch motifs in mediating protein–protein interactions is investigated here because the identification of its interactors will provide a better understanding of ACBP4 function in planta. Kelch motifs, structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein kelch, allow protein folding into a cylindrical ‘β-propeller structure’ (Adams et al., 2000) forming a potential protein–protein interaction domain (Andrade et al., 2001). A bait-containing sequence encoding ACBP4 was constructed for yeast two-hybrid screens using a cDNA library derived from A. thaliana to identify proteins that interact directly with ACBP4. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions. Subsequently, localization of ACBP4 and its interacting protein, AtEBP, was confirmed using transient expression of GFP- and DsRed-tagged fusion proteins in Nicotiana tabacum. When the spatial and temporal expression of ACBP4 and AtEBP was examined by Northern blot analyses, their similar induced expression by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments, and Botrytis cinerea implicate the feasibility of their potential roles in plant defence.</text><annotation id="5"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="3831" length="202"/><text>The role of its kelch motifs in mediating protein–protein interactions is investigated here because the identification of its interactors will provide a better understanding of ACBP4 function in planta.</text></annotation><annotation id="6"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="4034" length="265"/><text>Kelch motifs, structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein kelch, allow protein folding into a cylindrical ‘β-propeller structure’ (Adams et al., 2000) forming a potential protein–protein interaction domain (Andrade et al., 2001).</text></annotation><annotation id="7"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="4300" length="123"/><text>A bait-containing sequence encoding ACBP4 was constructed for yeast two-hybrid screens using a cDNA library derived from A.</text></annotation><annotation id="8"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="4489" length="84"/><text>Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5091</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5113</offset><text>Yeast strain</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5126</offset><text>The two-hybrid library screens were performed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPB2 [MATa ara3 his3 ade2 lys2 trp1 leu2, 112 canr gal4 gal80 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL1UAS17mers)-lacZ] (Kohalmi et al., 1998).

The resulting vector was subject to DNA sequence analysis to confirm the presence of an in-frame fusion, before use in transformation of S. cerevisiae mating type strain PJ69-4A, followed by testing for autoactivation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Library screenings were conducted using the Molecular Interaction Facility Arabidopsis library collection representing cDNAs from flowering Arabidopsis plants. Approximately 50 million clones were screened. Of these, positive yeast clones were tested for interaction by selection on histidine drop-out and β-galactosidase assays. Plasmids were rescued and analysed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Positive prey plasmids were retransformed into the mating type of PJ69-4A and validated in mating and selection assays with the ACBP4 bait, the empty bait vector, and unrelated control baits. Positive clones were subsequently identified by nucleotide sequence analysis using the GAL(TA)-specific forward primer BC304 (5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACC-3′) and the ADH1-terminator reverse primer, JN069 (5′-TTGATTGGAGACTTGACC-3′) (Kohalmi et al., 1998).</text><annotation id="12"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="6959" length="288"/><text>To ensure sufficient coverage in the identification of potential proteins interacting with ACBP4, yeast two-hybrid screenings were also performed at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison using yeast strains and vectors as previously described by James et al.</text></annotation><annotation id="13"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0432</infon><location offset="7256" length="182"/><text>For bait preparation, ACBP4 (amino acids 1–669) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of bait vector pBUTE (a kanamycin-resistant version of GAL4 bait vector pGBDUC1).</text></annotation><annotation id="14"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0432</infon><location offset="7579" length="115"/><text>cerevisiae mating type strain PJ69-4A, followed by testing for autoactivation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8556</offset><text>Co-immunoprecipitation</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8579</offset><text>To corroborate the interaction from yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed according to Mongiat et al.

Briefly, 30 μg of total RNA were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham). To generate probes for use in Northern blot analyses, specific primers were designed for PCR-amplification: ACBP4 (ML350, 5′-CCTCGAGAATGGCTATGCCTAGGGC-3′ and ML682, 5′-GGATCCACAAGGCGAATCATCATCT-3′), AtEBP (ML826, 5′-ACAGAGAAAATGTGTGGCGG-3′ and ML827, 5′-CAAGCATCCACATAT CCACC-3′) and PDF1.2 (ML741, 5′-TAAGTTTGCTTCCATCATCACCC-3′ and ML742, 5′-TTAACATGGGACGTAACAGATACA-3′). Templates used in PCR were plasmid pAT282 (consisting of the ACBP4 cDNA) and the first-strand wild-type pool of cDNAs (for AtEBP and PDF1.2). The fragments were labelled with the PCR Digoxigenin Probe Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Germany).

A GAL4(TA) tagged A. thaliana cDNA library was introduced into the yeast YPB2 harbouring plasmid pAT188. The number of independent transformants was determined to be 2×106 following transformation and plating of an aliquot of the yeast transformation mixture on [SD-leu-trp]. A total of 100 putative positives were selected on [SD-leu-trp-his] supplemented with 10 mM 3-AT medium. When these putative positives were further screened for β-galactosidase activity using the X-Gal colony filter assay, nine yeast clones that appeared blue, at varying intensities, were identified as putative clones encoding interactors. Putative library plasmids were retrieved and their nucleotide sequences were searched against the BLAST server http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST. Only one clone was in-frame to GAL4(TA), encoding a full-length ethylene-responsive element binding factor (ERF) protein AtEBP (Arabidopsis genome locus: AT3G16770). An AP2/EREBP (ethylene-responsive element binding protein) domain is present in AtEBP at amino acids 76–143 (Okamuro et al., 1997). In another independent yeast two-hybrid screen using the Molecular Interaction Facility (University of Wisconsin–Madison), six putative positives were identified following selection on histidine drop-out and β-galactosidase assays. Subsequently, they were used to retransform yeast mating type strain PJ69-4A, and were validated in mating and selection assays using the ACBP4 bait, the empty bait vector, and unrelated baits. Five clones were tested positive and further identified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Results from analysis using the BLAST revealed that only one clone was in-frame and it encoded a full-length actin-depolymerizing factor 3 (ADF3, At5g59880) protein.

Expression of the ethylene downstream regulator ERF1 is up-regulated upon infection by B. cinerea (Berrocal-Lobo et al., 2002). Since ACBP4 and AtEBP mRNAs accumulated in response to ethylene and jasmonate treatments, Arabidopsis plants were subsequently infected with B. cinerea and tested for ACBP4 and AtEBP expression. Both ACBP4 and AtEBP mRNAs accumulated in the infected plants at 48 h and 72 h post-inoculation, while the control plant remained uninduced at these corresponding time points (Fig. 5B).

However, another server LOCtree (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/services/loctree/; Nair and Rost, 2005) scored the Reliability Index (RI) value of AtEBP nuclear localization to be merely 1, in a range of RI values from 1–10, with 10 denoting the most confident prediction. LOCtree is a novel system of support vector machines that predict subcellular localization by the incorporation of a hierarchical ontology of localization classes modelled onto biological processing pathways (Nair and Rost, 2005). It is significantly more accurate than other traditional networks at predicting subcellular localization (Nair and Rost, 2005). In this study, GFP:AtEBP was not confined to the nucleus but was also detected in the cytosol where it could interact with ACBP4. ACBP4:DsRed, transiently-expressed in tobacco leaves, was predominantly targeted to the cytosol but immuno-electron microscopy indicated localization of ACBP4 in the cytosol with signals detected at the periphery of the nucleus, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with AtEBP. Many protein factors, such as the photoreceptor phytochrome B, COP1, and some bZIP transcription factors demonstrate light-regulated movement between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Yamamoto and Deng, 1999). Also, some transcription factors such as the Arabidopsis floral identity protein LEAFY (LFY), do move between cells (Wu et al., 2003). Therefore, interactions between ACBP4 and AtEBP at the cytosol, a location common to both may permit their similar translocation across subcellular compartments or between cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>33898</offset><text>Interaction of ACBPs and transcription factors</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33945</offset><text>When Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened for interacting proteins of Arabidopsis ACBPs by the yeast two-hybrid system in our laboratory, as well as at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison, while we could not identify protein interactors for ACBP5, a common interacting protein (AtEBP) was identified for both ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004) and ACBP4. AtEBP, containing one AP2/EREBP domain, belongs to the ERF subfamily of AP2/EREBP family of plant transcription factors involved in plant growth and developmental regulation (Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 1998). The conserved AP2/EREBP domain unique to plants, has been reported to be involved in DNA binding (Ohme-Tagaki and Shinshi, 1995) and in mediating protein–protein interactions (Okamuro et al., 1997). Proteins of the ERF subfamily have been demonstrated to be mainly expressed in response to biological or physical stress, such as pathogen attack, ethylene or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, drought, and cold treatment (Zhang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005). Recently, Ogawa et al. (2005) demonstrated that AtEBP conferred resistance to Bax and abiotic stress-induced plant cell death in plant cells overexpressing AtEBP. Furthermore, the function of AtEBP as a transcriptional activator may be related to ethylene signalling based on the analysis of gene expression levels in ethylene-related mutants (Ogawa et al., 2005).</text><annotation id="39"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="33945" length="381"/><text>When Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened for interacting proteins of Arabidopsis ACBPs by the yeast two-hybrid system in our laboratory, as well as at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison, while we could not identify protein interactors for ACBP5, a common interacting protein (AtEBP) was identified for both ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004) and ACBP4.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35363</offset><text>Several ERF proteins have been reported to interact with other proteins including a transcriptional factor, a nitrilase-like protein, and an ubiquitin-conjugated enzyme (Büttner and Singh, 1997; Xu et al., 1998; Koyama et al., 2003). AtEBP was reported to interact in particular with an ocs element binding protein (Büttner and Singh, 1997) and ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004). A highly conserved motif RAYD element within the AP2/EREBP domain contains a conserved core region that is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix. This α-helical structure has been implicated in a role in DNA binding or in mediating protein–protein interactions important for RAP2.3 (AtEBP) function (Okamuro et al., 1997). The interactions between ACBPs and AtEBP imply that certain ACBPs could be involved in the regulation of plant development or defence through interactions with the transcription factor AtEBP. Long-chain acyl-CoAs have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression in bacteria, yeast, and mammals (Black et al., 2000). Petrescu et al. (2003) has reported that recombinant mouse ACBP in rat hepatoma cells and in transfected COS-7 cells interacts with the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), a nuclear binding protein that regulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. HNF-4α also catalyses the hydrolysis of bound long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, and subsequently binds the fatty acid product, thus allowing cross-talk between acyl-CoA-binding sites and free fatty acid binding sites in HNF-4α (Hertz et al., 2005).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>36917</offset><text>ACBP4 may play a role in plant defence and related signalling pathways</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36988</offset><text>ACBP4 has been reported to bind oleoyl-CoA esters in vitro (Leung et al., 2004). Enzymes that use acyl-CoA esters but do not contain any acyl-CoA-binding domain could possibly dock to acyl-CoA-binding proteins, via protein–protein interactions at the ankyrin repeats of ACBP1 and ACBP2 or via such interactions at the kelch motifs of ACBP4 and ACBP5, to retrieve acyl-CoA substrates. If ACBP4 were a transporter and pool former of acyl-CoA esters, it would donate acyl-CoA esters to regulatory factors reminiscent of yeast ACBP in the gene regulation of OLE1, in which saturated fatty acids induce OLE1 transcription while unsaturated fatty acids repress its expression (Choi et al., 1996). In plants, fatty acid-derived signals have been implicated in the regulation of plant defence and development (Farmer et al., 1998). Calcium-independent phospholipase A2β, a multifunctional signalling enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of saturated fatty acyl-CoAs at physiologically relevant concentrations, is selectively autoacylated by oleoyl-CoA, is protected from autoacylation by Ca2+-activated calmodulin, and is rescued from calmodulin-mediated inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity by oleoyl-CoA (Jenkins et al., 2006).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38216</offset><text>The present study demonstrates that ACBP4, like its identified protein partner AtEBP, is induced by the defence signals ethylene, and jasmonate, and the fungal pathogen B. cinerea. The clear roles of ethylene and jasmonate in plant defence signalling, development, and in environmental stress mitigation is relatively well-established. Our results now suggest a possible role for ACBP4, working in conjunction with AtEBP, in mediating plant defence- and ethylene-related signalling pathways. While the precise roles for ACBP4 and AtEBP need to be addressed further, it appears that the roles of the new family of six Arabidopsis ACBPs (Leung et al., 2004) are not restricted to binding acyl-CoAs in various subcellular compartments in plant lipid metabolism, but may possibly be extended to the transfer of acyl-CoAs in relation to plant defence- and ethylene-related signalling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="volume">10</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Cooley;given-names:L</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Kelso;given-names:R</infon><infon
