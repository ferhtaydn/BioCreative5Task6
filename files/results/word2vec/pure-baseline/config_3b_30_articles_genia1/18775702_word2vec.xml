The interacting regions of hnRNP-K with p30 were established within residues 35–197, which represent KH1 and KH2 domains responsible for RNA binding. Colocalization of hnRNP-K and p30 was observed mainly in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm of infected cells and infection modified hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and decreased the incorporation of 5-fluorouridine into nascent RNA. Since similar effects were observed in cells transiently expressing p30, this interaction provides new insights into p30 function and could represent a possible additional mechanism by which ASFV downregulates host cell mRNA translation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>975</offset><text>Structured summary</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>994</offset><text>MINT-6742660:</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1008</offset><text>hnRNP-K (uniprotkb:P61978) physically interacts (MI:0218)</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1066</offset><text>with p30 (uniprotkb:Q8V1E7) by pull down (MI:0096)</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="1066" length="50"/><text>with p30 (uniprotkb:Q8V1E7) by pull down (MI:0096)</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1117</offset><text>MINT-6742673, MINT-6742696, MINT-6742729:</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1159</offset><text>hnRNP-K (uniprotkb:P61978) physically interacts (MI:0218)</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1217</offset><text>with p30 (uniprotkb:Q8V1E7) by two hybrid (MI:0018)</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1269</offset><text>MINT-6742711:</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1283</offset><text>p30 (uniprotkb:Q8V1E7) and hnRNP-K (uniprotkb:P61978) colocalize (MI:0403) by fluorescence microscopy (MI:0416)</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="1283" length="111"/><text>p30 (uniprotkb:Q8V1E7) and hnRNP-K (uniprotkb:P61978) colocalize (MI:0403) by fluorescence microscopy (MI:0416)</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1395</offset></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1396</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1409</offset><text>African swine fever virus (ASFV), the only member of the Asfarviridae family, is a large, cytoplasmic, double-stranded DNA virus that is responsible of a haemorrhagic and frequently fatal disease of swine [1]. The viral genome comprises more than 150 open reading frames and expression is regulated in a temporal fashion. So, viral genes are classified as early or late depending on their requirement for viral DNA synthesis [2]. Little is known about the regulatory functions of ASFV proteins during infection and early virus proteins are important candidates to play critical roles in the modification of cellular metabolism to take advantage of host cell functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2078</offset><text>ASFV open reading frame CP204L encodes a 30 kDa protein named p30 or p32 [3,4] which represents the most abundantly expressed viral protein early in infection. p30 exhibits a predominantly cytoplasmic location within infected cells and results phosphorylated in serine residues at the N-terminal [4] before its final incorporation to the viral particle. p30 is also one of the most antigenic ASFV proteins [5], eliciting virus neutralizing antibodies in infected animals [6–8]. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for p30 in first stages of infection, since antibodies against p30 are able to inhibit virus internalization into the host cell [6]. Nevertheless, the regulatory function of p30 upon infection remains largely unknown.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2819</offset><text>To explore the potential targets of p30 during infection, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a porcine macrophage (the natural viral host cell) cDNA library for cellular proteins that may interact with p30.

It has been demonstrated to interact with different molecules involved in signal transduction such as Src, Fyn and Lyn [16]. Recently, a number of new hnRNP-K partners have been identified by using a proteomic approach [17] and new roles have been suggested for this protein. ASFV p30 was found to interact directly with host hnRNP-K during ASFV infection and we have mapped the interacting regions of both proteins. p30 modifies hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and could contribute to modulate hnRNP-K functions related to processing and export of mRNAs during ASFV infection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4069</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4091</offset><text>Plasmids</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4100</offset><text>For the yeast two-hybrid assay, plasmids pGBT9 and pACT2 (BD Sciences) were used as sources of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) and transcriptional activation domain (AD), respectively.

One feature which distinguishes hnRNP-K from other hnRNPs is the presence of three repeated K homology motives (KH) which are responsible for RNA-binding [26–28]. Interestingly, the p30 interacting region within hnRNP-K contains KH1 and KH2 motives, suggesting that the interaction described might modify hnRNP-K functions such as processing and export of the cellular mRNAs than on signal transduction pathways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18715</offset><text>hnRNP-K has been previously described to interact with several proteins from diverse viruses. Core protein from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus (DEN), are proposed to relieve the repressive effect of hnRNP-K on transcription regulation of different human genes in vivo, disrupting the multiple functions of hnRNP-K and contributing to virus pathogenesis [11,12]. Studies with phosphoprotein IE63 (also named ICP27) from Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suggest that an IE63-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-K by casein kinase 2, results in inhibition of binding to RNA, affecting transport of cellular mRNAs and altering the subcellular location of hnRNP-K [13]. Nevertheless, no homology sequence in nucleotides or amino acids has been found when comparing these virus proteins interacting with hnRNP-K, including p30, indicating that this common interaction could occur in multiple and diverse ways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19621</offset><text>During ASFV infection, hnRNP-K normal function could be affected since changes related to hnRNP-K subcellular distribution are observed. First, accumulation of hnRNP-K within the nucleus of ASFV infected cells was evident and subsequently the levels of cytoplasmic hnRNP-K decreased while nuclear levels were increased, as infection proceeded, supporting the idea that accumulation of hnRNP-K within nucleus is most likely due to relocation from cytoplasm. Changes in hnRNP-K subcellular distribution have been reported previously in poliovirus infection where virus infection affects the normal nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of the host cell [29]. Second, this hnRNP-K accumulation is coincident with the appearance of granular structures in the nucleus where the ribonucleoprotein is detected. Since no nucleic acids can be detected in these areas, these structures could represent inactive sites within the nucleus where hnRNP-K remains sequestered as consequence of infection, as postulated for HSV1 [13]. Similar structures have been previously reported during HCV infection. In this case, HCV core protein and hnRNP-K also colocalized in granules in the nucleus [12]. The presence of p30 in nucleus colocalizing with hnRNP-K suggests an involvement of this interaction in the appearance of these characteristic structures. Moreover, the identification of these structures also in cells transiently expressing p30 supports this idea.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21061</offset><text>Interestingly, neither conventional nuclear localization nor classical nuclear import signal have been previously found within ASFV protein p30 sequence, since it exhibits a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution. In this report we have demonstrated that small amounts of p30 are also present in the nucleus of the infected cell, so it can not be excluded that interaction with shuttling protein in cytoplasm could facilitate p30 traffic to the cell nucleus. Nevertheless, colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm during infection was not detectable by immunofluorescence, probably because of the low relative abundance of hnRNP-K in cytoplasm and its shuttling properties which difficult its visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy.</text><annotation id="16"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="21520" length="289"/><text>Nevertheless, colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm during infection was not detectable by immunofluorescence, probably because of the low relative abundance of hnRNP-K in cytoplasm and its shuttling properties which difficult its visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21810</offset><text>In conclusion, protein p30 could have further regulatory actions associated to its specific binding to hnRNP-K protein in the nucleus of infected cells. It is well known that viruses have evolved different mechanisms to alter host cell transcription and translation to promote transcription of its own DNA [30]. Here, we confirmed that all changes observed in hnRNP-K distribution during ASFV infection take place simultaneously with an extraordinary reduction in 5-fluouridine (FU) incorporation into nascent RNA, which represents an alteration in the cellular transcriptional activity. One way to inhibit cellular transcription is the recruitment of host cell RNA polymerase II. Nevertheless this is not a requirement for ASFV, since α-amanitin does not inhibit the production of infectious virus [31]. However, in cell systems previously studied (macrophages and Vero cells), ASFV infection produces a general shut-off of protein synthesis that affects up to 65% of the cellular proteins [2,32,33]. This inhibition of protein synthesis is detectable very early after ASFV infection, so it will be interesting to determine whether the interaction here described is contributing to the general host cell shut-off or to a concrete cellular pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>23060</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="name_3">surname:Rock;given-names:D.L.</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Martins;given-names:C.</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Escribano;given-names:J.M.</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Dixon;given-names:L.K.</infon><infon key="fpage">135</infon><infon key="year">2004</infon><infon key="source">Virus Taxonomy, VIII Report of the ICTV</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="name_10">surname:Ball;given-names:L.A.</infon><infon key="name_9">surname:Desselberger;given-names:U.</infon><infon key="name_8">surname:Maniloff;given-names:J.</infon><infon key="name_7">surname:Mayo;given-names:M.A.</infon><infon key="lpage">143</infon><infon key="name_6">surname:Fauquet;given-names:C.M.</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Wilkinson;given-names:P.J.</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Salas;given-names:M.L.</infon><offset>23071</offset></passage><passage><infon key="volume">92</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Tabares;given-names:E.</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Escribano;given-names:J.M.</infon><infon key="fpage">221</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">3101652</infon><infon key="year">1987</infon><infon key="source">Arch.

After extensive washing and elution from beads, resulting protein complexes were electrophoresed and analyzed by WB with monoclonal anti-p30 or anti-p54 serum (see Section 2). (B) As described before, ASFV infected (BA71V) or mock infected (MI) protein cell extracts were incubated with GST-hnRNP-K (GST-K) beads and analyzed by WB with anti-p30 monoclonal antibody.

A representative image of an infected cell at 8 hpi is shown (A). p30 was detected with a monoclonal anti-p30 followed by Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (red) and hnRNP-K with an anti-hnRNP-K specific serum followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (green). Discrete spots of colocalization of both proteins (orange) can be discerned in the cell nucleus. Bar, 10 μm. (B) Quantification of colocalization during infection. As described above, the nuclei of 30 infected cells were analyzed each time for hnRNP-K (black bars), p30 (white bars) and colocalization (grey bars) fluorescence emission.

(A) Vero cells were either infected with BA71V (1 pfu/cell) or transfected with pCMV-p30 and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy at 8 hpi or 24 h post transfection, respectively. ASFV protein p30 was detected with a mouse anti-p30 monoclonal antibody and rhodamine red conjugated corresponding secondary antibody (red). hnRNP-K distribution in the cell nucleus was detected with a rabbit antiserum anti-hnRNP-K and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated corresponding secondary antibody (green). Nuclei of cells were stained with Hoechst 3332. Accumulation of hnRNP-K in infected cells as spots which are coincident with the absence of nucleic acids staining can be appreciated in BA71V infected and pCMV-p30 transfected cells. Details of hnRNP-K accumulation are amplified from selected areas. (B) Comparison between uninfected and 12 hpi BA71V infected cell nuclei is shown in more detail. Arrows indicate the position of some of these structures in detail within the nucleus of an infected cell (bottom), but not in a non infected cell (top).

Vero cells were infected with 5 pfu/cell of BA71V strain and analyzed by WB with specific antibodies at different times after infection. (A) p30 and hnRNP-K were detected in total protein cell extracts with specific antibodies (see Section 2). β-Tubulin was detected to ensure that same amount of total protein was loaded. (B) Levels of hnRNP-K were analyzed independently from nuclear and cytoplasmic protein infected cell extracts. One of three representative experiments is shown including the relative intensities of quantified hnRNP-K (rel. int.). β-Tubulin detection was included as quality control of the cellular fractionation. (C) Vero cells were infected with BA71V (0.5 pfu/cell) and analyzed at 12 hpi for incorporation of FU into nascent RNA after FU pulse (see Section 2) to evaluate transcriptional activity. Arrows indicate the position of infected cells identified by p30 detection with specific antibody. Note the increase of nuclear hnRNP-K staining of infected cells when compared to the non infected cells. Bar, 30 μm.</text></passage></document></collection>
