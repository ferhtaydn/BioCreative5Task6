As bait the sequences encoding the MEINOXSTM domain (amino acids 116–220 of the STM protein) or the slightly longer MEINOX-ELKSTM (amino acids 116–287) domain were cloned into the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) and expressed in fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain.
0809
Verified cDNA inserts were either directly transferred into appropriate secondary vectors for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), co-immunoprecipitation or transgenic experiments and served as templates in second-round PCR-amplification to remove the stop codon or to adjust open reading frames (ORFs) for translational fusions.

HA-tagged (1/3 aliquot) partner proteins were identified using an anti-HA horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (clone 3F10; Roche 2012819).
0019
In addition to the interactions in yeast, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope-tagged full-length proteins. The HA-tagged BLH proteins shown in Figure 2B were used to co-precipitate epitope-tagged STM-His (Figure 2C).

0019
The co-immunoprecipitation experiments therefore confirm that the full-length STM protein interacts with full-length ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 proteins in vitro and substantiate the affinity of BLH/STM interactions.
0809
According to our BiFC results, however, STM is targeted into the nucleus as a heterodimer with ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9.

A 5-Å gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the CH2-CH3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins.
0402
The Fc proteins were immobilized on the surface of a biosensor chip, and the binding of CgE was assayed at pH 8 and pH 6.

0019
The relatively low affinity of the CgE/Fc interaction likely explains why a CgE/Fc binding interaction was not detectable by coimmunoprecipitation analyses [16].
0114
The complex crystals could not be improved by changing the gE-gI or Fc construct or by manipulating the crystals (summarized inMaterials and Methods). A 5.0-Å native data set was collected from the best of several hundred crystals (Table S2) and used for molecular replacement with the IgG Fc (pdb entry 1dn2) and CgE structures as search models. A molecular replacement solution was obtained when the Fc was positioned first followed by two CgE molecules, one bound to each Fc chain.
0114
The molecular replacement solution positions a CgE molecule near the CH2-CH3 linker on each of the Fc chains to make an approximately two-fold symmetric 2:1 gE-gI complex (Figure 3A). The model allows sufficient space in the unit cell for gI and NgE, which are unaccounted for in the molecular replacement solution, and shows a plausible packing arrangement including contacts between crystallographically related CgE molecules. Other features of the molecular replacement solution suggest that it is correct.
0114
We used experimental phasing methods to independently corroborate the molecular replacement model. A screen of complex crystals that had been soaked in various heavy-atom compounds resulted in four approximately isomorphous data sets (Table S2). An initial analysis of a KIrCl3 derivative identified five iridium sites located near the Fc molecule as positioned in the molecular replacement solution, four of which are related by the Fc dimer symmetry and two of which make a chemically-plausible interaction with a methionine (Met358) on each half of the Fc dimer (Figure 3B).

0114
An overlay of the molecular replacement model with a 5-Å heavy atom–phased electron density map (Figure S2) shows overlap of the model with electron density, including density for theN-linked carbohydrates attached to the CH2 domain of Fc, and extra density that likely corresponds to gI and NgE. Thus, experimental phasing methods using a combination of heavy-atom derivatives and SeMet-substituted crystals provides further confirmation of the molecular replacement solution and validates its use as a model for the CgE/Fc interaction in the context of the gE-gI/Fc complex.
0114
Of the five resulting models for the CgE/Fc interaction, one is similar to the crystallographic model obtained by molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods (Figure 3C).
0114
Crystal structures are available for Fc complexed with four other proteins, domain B1 of protein A [25], domain C2 of protein G [28], rheumatoid factor [24], and FcRn [27], and with one peptide that bind to this region [19].
0114
Although we cannot rule out local conformational variability that occurs as a function of pH, it seems unlikely that CgE undergoes large changes in conformation due to its relative compactness as a single domain, and arguments against pH-induced conformational changes in Fc have been made based on the similarity of Fc crystal structures at pH values between 4.1 and 8.0 [27].
0114
Because we were able to solve the crystal structure of the CgE subunit of the gE-gI ectodomain at high resolution, the identification of CgE as a minimal Fc-binding domain (Figure 1) made its structure useful for interpreting the low-resolution gE-gI/Fc complex structure. An independent prediction of the complex structure using the coordinates of the unbound CgE and Fc molecules revealed a close agreement with the experimentally determined gE-gI/Fc structure (Figure 3C), demonstrating the power of new protein docking methods [33,34], and their potential for facilitating difficult crystallographic problems.
0114
As revealed in the low resolution crystal structure of a gE-gI/Fc complex, the CgE portion of gE-gI binds to Fc at the CH2-CH3 interdomain junction (Figure 3A), consistent with previous studies of the gE-gI/Fc interaction [12,21,23] and allowing a comparison of the Fc-binding properties of CgE with other proteins that bind to the same site on Fc [19,20,27].
0114
The model for CgE binding to Fc derived from the crystal structures of CgE and a gE-gI/Fc complex can be used to gain insight into the regions of CgE that are implicated in cell-to-cell spread of HSV.
0402
In this system, binding between a molecule coupled to a biosensor chip (the “ligand”) and a second molecule injected over the chip (the “analyte”) results in changes in the surface plasmon resonance signal that are read out in real time as resonance units [54]. wtFc and nbFc, both derived from human IgG1, were purified from CHO cell supernatants as described previously [12] and immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip (Biacore) using primary-amine coupling as described by the manufacturer.
0114
Microseeding increased the frequency of obtaining single crystals. SeMet-substituted CgE crystals were grown in conditions similar to the native crystals with the addition of 10 mM MgCl2 in the well solution, which decreased the disorder that was often observed in the diffraction of the native crystals. All crystals were cryoprotected in well solution with an additional 15% PEG 4000, added in 5% increments, and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection at −180 °C.
0114
For heavy-atom screening, complex crystals were soaked in 38 different heavy-atom compounds for between 18 h to 7 d, back-soaked for 2–3 h during cryopreservation, and screened for diffraction and fluorescence at the appropriate energies. Four datasets, which were collected near thef′′ peak energies for crystals that were soaked in KIrCl3, PIP, EMP, or Na2WO4, were isomorphous with the native data set (Table S2).
0114
(C) Stereo superposition of the crystallographically determined CgE/Fc complex and the complex predicted with RosettaDock [34] using the structures of CgE and Fc. A half complex (one CgE and one chain of the Fc dimer) is shown with Fc in green, the CgE as positioned in the crystal structure in blue, and the CgE as positioned by the docking prediction in pink. The root mean square deviation between the Cα atoms of the Rosetta-positioned CgE molecule and each of the CgE molecules in the molecular replacement solution is 3.9 Å, with the alignment being the best in the regions of CgE that are closest to the CgE/Fc interface and poorest in the regions that are more distant from the binding site.
0114
However, this β-hairpin is well packed against strand 6 of monomer C itself and appears to be an intrinsic feature of the Munc13–1 C2A domain, because the two Munc13–1 monomers present in the crystal structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2 heterodimer also contain this β-hairpin (see below).
0114
Hence, we designed two charge-reversal mutations, K32E and E63K, to disrupt Munc13–1 homodimerization based on the crystal structure of the C2A-domain homodimer.
0114
All these results strongly suggest that the monomer A/RIM2α82–142 complex observed in the crystals faithfully reflects the true Munc13–1/RIM2α binding mode, whereas the presence of a second Munc13–13–150(K32E) molecule in the crystals must be considered a consequence of crystal packing.
0114
Our Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 structure, together with the crystal structure of a rabphilin/Rab3A complex [27], and the sequence homology between rabphilin and RIM2α, also provide an explanation for our previous observations that Munc13–1, RIM2α, and Rab3A form a tripartite complex and that Munc13–1 alters the RIM2α/Rab3A binding mode [20].

In the past, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography were largely viewed as alternative methods for structure determination of biomolecules, but the usefulness of combining the strengths of both techniques is increasingly being recognized [32,33].

In the past, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography were largely viewed as alternative methods for structure determination of biomolecules, but the usefulness of combining the strengths of both techniques is increasingly being recognized [32,33]. On the other hand, two structural genomics studies recently indicated that there is no overt correlation between1H-15N HSQC spectral quality and successful crystallization of protein targets [34,35]. However, it is unclear to what extent the fragment length of each target was optimized in these studies, and a separate structural genomics effort suggested that NMR spectra can be used to identify promising targets for structure determination by X-ray crystallography [36]. The data presented here, together with our previous NMR analysis of Munc13–1/α-RIM/Rab3 interactions [20], provide a particularly compelling illustration of how NMR spectroscopy can assist in X-ray diffraction studies of protein complexes that present particularly challenging problems for crystallization, and at the same time can provide complementary information. Thus,1H-15N HSQC spectra were instrumental to map the regions involved in these interactions, to identify sequences of the complexes that can hinder crystallization because they are unstructured and promote aggregation, to interpret the X-ray results, and to resolve ambiguities. Altogether, these observations suggest that combining the strengths of NMR spectroscopy in fragment optimization and analysis of protein–protein interactions in solution with the high accuracy of structure determination by X-ray crystallography for biomolecules of any size will be particularly useful to study complex protein networks.

Unlabeled and isotopically labeled proteins were expressed in bacteria as GST fusions as described [20].

1 B) and endogenous integrins that were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against α1, α2, α5, α6, and β1 subunits (Fig.

Evidence from detailed biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Stefansson et al., 2004; Vinogradova et al., 2004) indicates that upon integrin activation the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails move out of the membrane into the cytoplasm, revealing the highly conserved residues to the cytoplasmic face and involving substantial structural changes in the cytoplasmic tails.
0411
The cells were lysed (200 mM NaCl, 75 mM Tris, 15 mM NaF, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 7.5 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM EGTA, 1.5% Triton-X-100, and Complete), and the amount of biotinylated integrin was assayed using the anti–β1-integrin antibody AIIB2 to capture the integrins and HRP anti-biotin antibody for ELISA detection.

To investigate the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA translation and to determine the interactions of P-body components with the RNAi machinery, we constructed expression vectors for the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E.

0019
These vectors were co-expressed in HeLa cells with Myc-tagged Ago2 and immunopurified using anti-Myc antibodies. The protein composition of isolated complexes was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Myc. When total cell extracts (TCE) were analyzed to determine the protein expression efficiencies of the vectors used in these experiments (Figure 1A, TCE lane), all YFP- and Myc-tagged proteins were expressed. Analysis of immunopurified complexes revealed that Ago1, Dcp2, RCK/p54, and eIF4E formed complexes with Ago2 (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane).
0019
To address this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with vectors to co-express Myc-Ago2 and the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E, subjected to RNase A digestion, and immunopurified. Analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Myc-Ago2 were not affected by RNase treatment, whereas the amounts of Dcp2 and eIF4E protein that co-purified with Myc-Ago2 decreased significantly (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane). Control experiments analyzing Myc-Ago2 showed that equal amounts of complexes were purified (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane).
0012
To visualize protein–protein interactions in vivo, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a probe. In FRET, a fluorescent donor molecule transfers energy via a nonradiative dipole–dipole interaction to an acceptor molecule [46]. We used a well-known donor: acceptor fluorescent-protein pair, CFP:YFP, with a Förster distance (R 0) of 4.9 nm [47].

0019
In cells expressing CFP-Ago2 and YFP-Lsm1, FRET efficiency was not significant (1.62% ± 1.11%), corroborating our immunoprecipitation results (Figure 1A).
0019
Immunoblot analysis of affinity-purified miRISC using anti-Myc, anti-Flag, anti-RCK/p54, and anti-eIF4E antibodies (Figure 3C) showed that Myc-Ago1, Flag-Ago2, and RCK/p54 were associated with let-7 miRISC.
0019
24 h after transfecting cells with siRNA, real-time quantitative PCR showed that mRNA levels decreased by more than 90% and immunoblot analysis showed that RCK/p54 protein levels decreased significantly without affecting the levels of other P-body proteins including Lsm1 and Ago2 (Figure S2).
0019
After immunoprecipitation, RISC activities were analyzed by incubating the supernatant (S) or bead (B) phases with 182-nt 32P-cap-labeled let-7 substrate mRNAs having a perfectly complementary or mismatched sequence to the let-7 miRNA.
0019
To examine the RNA dependence of protein–protein interactions, TCEs (250 μg) were treated before immunoprecipitation with 0.2 μg/ul of RNase A for 20 min at room temperature. Myc-tagged proteins were precipitated by incubating overnight with polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc antibodies directly conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, California, United States). Samples were washed four times in lysis buffer and eluted by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot. For immunoblotting, antibodies included monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (BD Biosciences), anti-eIF4E and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-Flag (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States); polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-DDX6 (rck/p54; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Texas, United States); and polyclonal chicken anti-Lsm1 (GenWay Biotech Incorporated, San Diego, California, United States).

The signals were detected by a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP2) attached to a Leica DMIRE inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with an argon laser, two HeNe lasers, an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) to attenuate individual visible laser lines, and a tunable acousto-optical beam splitter (AOBS).

0055
For FRET studies, HeLa cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and washed three times with PBS.

Western-blot analysis of whole cell lysates indicated that both proteins were expressed, albeit at different levels, and that expression of ephrin-B1 did not influence the phosphorylation status of Cx43 (detected by differences in mobility on a SDS-PAGE), which is known to regulate GJC (Figure 7A).

First, Abp1 not only interacts with Cdc23 (Mcm10) protein in the two-hybrid analysis, but deletion of Abp1 lowers the restrictive temperature for cdc23-M36, consistent with its proposed role in DNA replication.

Figure 5C and Figure S6B illustrate that double staining for Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) followed by FACS analysis revealed a major increase in Annexin V+ PI− (apoptotic) cells following transduction with the negative control shRNA followed by either γ irradiation or treatment with etoposide, whereas there was no increase in apoptotic cells above baseline in the cells depleted of NHE-1: DNA damage–induced apoptosis was blocked 100%. Comparable results were obtained by measuring the sub-G1 peak by FACS (unpublished data) and NHE-1 depletion also correlated with increased survival (Figure S5B).

Furthermore, comparison of the crystal structures of native rat Bcl-xL with its deamidated version has revealed significant differences [10]; the structural implications of introducing iso-Asp residues into the disordered loop environment of Asn52/Asn66 merits further work.

These immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCL, 1% NP-40 and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail III (Calbiochem). Aliquots (20 μl) of immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) to check the success of the immunoprecipitation experiments. His-tagged MELK recombinant proteins (0.5 μM WT-MELK and D150A-MELK) were reacted for 30 minutes at 30°C with aliquots (20 μl) of immunoprecipitates of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (FL, N-1 N-2, N-3 and N-4) as substrates in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM DTT, 40 mM NaF, 40 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μM cold-ATP, 10 Ci of [γ-32P] ATP (GE Healthcare) and 10 mM MgCL2.
0019
COS7 cells (1 × 106) were co-transfected with 8 μg each of Flag-tagged pCAGGSn3FH vectors (Flag-Bcl-GL and Flag-Mock) and HA-tagged pCAGGSnHC vectors (HA-WT-MELK, HA-D150A-MELK and HA-Mock) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the supplier's protocol.
0096
Furthermore, we examined expression of endogenous Bcl-GL in breast cancer cell lines at the protein level by western blot analysis using an anti-Bcl-GL antibody and detected an approximately 30 kDa endogenous Bcl-GL, corresponding to the size identified by protein pull-down experiment, in all the breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure 3b).
0019
To validate an interaction between WT-MELK and Bcl-GL, we constructed plasmids designed to express HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL). These plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells and the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. Immunoblotting of the precipitates using anti-HA antibodies indicated that Flag-Bcl-GL was co-precipitated with HA-WT-MELK (Figure 3c).

0019
To further determine which segment of Bcl-GL can interact with WT-MELK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HA-WT-MELK and partial Bcl-GL proteins tagged with Flag (Figure 3e). After co-transfection of plasmid clones into HeLa cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, and then immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody.
0019
First, we confirmed the amount of immunoprecipitated protein corresponding to partial Bcl-GL (N-1, N-2, N-3 and N-4) as well as to full-length Bcl-GL (FL) by western blot analysis (Figure 3f), and then examined the extent of their phosphorylation (Figure 4c).
0019
To investigate this hypothesis, we transiently co-transfected two plasmid clones designed to express HA-tagged MELK (WT or D150A) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL into COS7 cells, and then performed a TUNEL assay and FACS analysis to measure the proportions of apoptotic cells (see Material and methods).

The expression of HA-tagged WT-MELK in total cell lysates was confirmed by western blotting analysis. As a control, immunoprecipitation was performed from cells co-transfected with pCAGGSn3FC (Mock) and HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) through all steps.

TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC was overexpressed together with Cdk5 or p35 in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed with Cdk5, p35, or pan-Trk antibody. Interestingly, all three Trk receptors were observed to associate with Cdk5 (Figure 1B) and p35 (Figure 1C), while no association was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG control.

0019
We found that TrkB associated with both p35 and Cdk5 in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat brain lysates (Figure 1D). Furthermore, Flag-tagged Cdk5 pulled down TrkB from the membrane fraction of adult brain lysates (Figure 1E).

0096
Furthermore, Flag-tagged Cdk5 pulled down TrkB from the membrane fraction of adult brain lysates (Figure 1E).

0018
We hypothesized that, although BRCA1 was shown to interact with PP1β in the two-hybrid screen, it might be capable of interacting with all three PP1 isoforms PP1 due to their high degree of sequence similarity.
0019
Coimmunoprecipitation of BRCA1 and PP1.

0019
(A) A western blot probed with BRCA1 shows that immunoprecipitation of protein with an antibody against the Flag-PP1α, β or γ proteins, but not Laf4, co-immunoprecipitates BRCA1 (Lanes 1A-1D).

We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N-terminal BAR-PH domain motif.
0114
In order to address the functional roles of the BAR-PH motif in APPL1 and related proteins, we have carried out structure-function studies on human APPL1 and determined the crystal structures of the Rab5-binding region of APPL1 as well as the BAR domain alone.
0114
The BAR domain crystal diffracted up to 1.8-Å resolution on a beamline at the Argonne Advanced Photon Source (APS) synchrotron facility. The crystal belongs to P21212 space group.
0114
The BAR-PH crystal diffracted to 2.05-Å resolution at the synchrotron facility. The crystal also belongs to P21212 space group.

0114
Phases of this crystal form were calculated using a combination of molecular replacement and SAD methods, and further improved with density modification.
0114
The canonical ligand-binding site is composed of β1, L1, β2, L3, and L6 (exemplified in the crystal structure of PLC-δ1, PDB file 1MAI) and, roughly speaking, is confined to a triangular area with L1, L3, and L6 as the three vertices.

0114
In our crystal structure of the APPL1 BAR-PH dimer, the two PH domains are located at the opposite ends of the crescent-shaped dimer, and each has fairly extensive contact with the BAR domain of its symmetry mate (Figure 1).
0114
Because of the interaction between D15SPxxR20 motif and PH domain, the rest N-terminus peptide (residues 5−12) clearly became ordered in the BAR-PH crystal structure, in comparison to the BAR domain-alone crystal structure, where residues N-terminal to Leu13 were invisible in the electron density map.

0114
Furthermore, the N-terminus is surrounded by a number of regions from the dimer partner, including the helix α4 and flexible loop connecting α1 and α2 (where residues 76−78 were mobile in the crystal structure).
0402
Rab5 was coupled to the SPR biosensor chip in random orientations, and APPL1 (5−419) was applied as the analyte at concentrations of 0.15−12 μM (Supplementary Figure 4).
0096
To identify Rab5-binding site(s) in APPL1, GST−Rab5-Q79L (full length) was used to pull down APPL1 variants having surface point mutations.

0276
The WT APPL1 (5−419) fragment was used as the parental construct for the mutagenesis, because this fragment is easily distinguishable from GST−Rab5 by size on SDS–PAGE gels without the need for Western blot analysis.
0114
Interaction between small GTPase and BAR domain has been exemplified in a complex crystal structure of Rac and arfaptin2 before (Tarricone et al, 2001).

0096
Second, the isolated APPL1 BAR domain did not bind to Rab5 in our pull-down assay.
0114
Furthermore, with the knowledge of crystal structures of Rab5–rabaptin5 and Rab22–rabenosyn5 complexes, it is clear that both Rab5 effectors rabaptin5 and rabenosyn5 bind to the so called invariant hydrophobic triad of Rab5 (i.e., Phe57, Trp74, and Tyr89) (Merithew et al, 2001).
0114
Combined results from our mutagenesis pull-down experiments (Figures 4, 5 and 6), crystal structures of the BAR-PH domain of APPL1 (Figure 1), and structures of GTPase domain of human Rab5 in different nucleotide binding modes (Zhu et al, 2003, 2004) clearly explain the requirement of GTP-bound Rab5 for APPL1 binding.

0114
Note that the L3-β4 region showed weak electron density in the crystal structure, indicating its higher mobility and possible adaptability in forming a complex with Rab5.
0114
So far, only two crystal structures of small GTPase−PH domain complexes are available.
0114
A similar N-BAR structure was predicted for APPL1 and APPL2 (Habermann, 2004), but our current APPL1 crystal structure does not show such a structural motif.
0114
Coordinates and the structural factors of the APPL1 crystal structures have been deposited to PDB under codes 2Q12 (BAR domain structure) and 2Q13 (BAR-PH domain structure).
0416
RFP−Rab5-Q79L was coexpressed with GFP−APPL1 (full length, FL; BAR-PH domain; or BAR-PH mutant) in PC12 cells as indicated, followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

We have determined the crystal structure of full-length ST in complex with PP2A A subunit at 3.1 Å resolution.
0114
The crystal structure of full-length SV40 small t antigen (ST) in complex with the A subunit of its target, protein phosphatase 2A, contributes to our understanding of the oncogenic functions of ST.
0114
The J domain contains three helices and has a structure similar to the previously solved crystal structure of the J domain of SV40 LT and a NMR structure of polyomavirus DnaJ-like domain [41,42], with Cα root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.84 and 1.83 Å, respectively.

The products were mixed and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies coupled onto protein A/G beads. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

0096
10% of the input proteins for pull down are shown at the left.
0019
To further substantiate its interaction with p65, an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay was applied in which full-length HA-p65 and FLAG-UXT proteins were generated and labeled, respectively, with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation. The products were mixed and immunoprecipitated with either control IgG or anti-HA antibody.
0019
The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively.
0019
(B) Cell lysates from A were subjected to Western blotting for determining endogenous UXT protein levels after siRNA transfection.
0413
This suggested that UXT positively regulated p65 inside the nucleus, and the loss of it affected the sustained action of p65 in the nucleus, which led to the attenuated EMSA results as observed in Fig.
0413
This rescuing effect was also confirmed with EMSA assays (Fig.
0019
(A) The HA-tagged wild-type UXT and siRNA-resistant UXT (UXTr) were cotransfected with the indicated siRNAs. After 24 h, cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for determining exogenous UXT protein levels.
0413
(C) 293T cells were induced by 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with the indicated antibodies to perform EMSA supershift assays.

0413
Nuclear lysates were used for EMSA to check endogenous NF-κB or sp1 DNA binding activities.
0413
Stimulation of 293T cells with TNF-α led to a strong NF-κB DNA-binding band composed of κB probe, NF-κB, and its cofactors in EMSA. Interestingly, this EMSA band was markedly diminished when antibody against UXT was introduced into the reaction mixture (Fig.
0413
However, immunofluorescence and EMSA experiments indicated that the knockdown of CARM1 did not affect the nuclear presence of p65 (Fig.
0019

0402
The ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with some variations.

0019
Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4°C overnight using antibodies as indicated with IgG as a negative control.
0014
Here, we demonstrate that β1AR forms a signaling complex with a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) in a manner inherently different from a β2AR/β-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously.
0014
Even though these highly homologous receptors both activate the G protein stimulatory for adenylyl cyclase (Gs), signaling through β1AR and β2AR produces clearly distinguishable biological effects (Xiang and Kobilka, 2003; Xiao et al, 2004).
0014
One of the emerging mechanisms that safeguard the specificity of G-protein-coupled receptor/cAMP signaling is the control of cAMP transients via degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (Conti and Beavo, 2007). Biochemical, electrophysiological, and in vivo imaging studies are consolidating the idea that occupancy of different receptors generates a nonuniform pattern of activation of cAMP effector proteins such as PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PDEs play a critical role for the specificity in cAMP-signaling by preventing the free diffusion of cAMP, thus, effectively creating cyclic nucleotide microdomains and/or cAMP gradients that can be sensed by the cell (Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002; Xiang et al, 2005; Fischmeister et al, 2006).
0019
To probe for a possible signaling complex including the β1AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged β1AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag. A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the β1AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (Figure 1A).

0019
Whereas ablation of PDE4A or PDE4B had no effect, inactivation of the PDE4D gene prevented co-IP of PDE activity with the β1AR (Figure 1B).

0019
This conclusion is further supported by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated PDE.
0014
Thus, the concentration-dependence of dissociation of the β1AR/PDE4D complex is comparable to that of receptor occupancy by NorEpi rather than that of receptor-induced cAMP production, which is in the nanomolar range.
0012
The β1AR/PDE4D complex is present in the absence of agonist and dissociates after receptor occupancy, whereas agonist binding to the β2AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of the β-arrestin/PDE4D complex to the receptor. Thus, under basal conditions, PDE4D is poised to control local cAMP concentration and PKA activity in the vicinity of the β1AR (see Figure 6), whereas it affects β2AR signaling only after ligand binding and β-arrestin recruitment.
0019
Recombinant Flag-tagged βARs and Myc-tagged PDE4D splice variants were detected in western blots using antibodies against their respective tags (mouse monoclonal α-Flag AB, Sigma Aldrich; mouse monoclonal α-Myc AB, Roche Applied Sciences).
0052
They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Nu Serum IV (BD Falcon), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM glutamine, 20 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1 × ITS media supplement (Sigma) on plates precoated with 10 μg/ml laminin.

0052
HEK293 and MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM glutamine, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
0019
Flag-tagged receptors were then immunoprecipitated using M1-affinity resin (α-Flag antibody resin; Sigma Aldrich).
0019
Flag-tagged β1AR and β2AR were also expressed in Sf9 cells and subsequently purified in a two-step procedure consisting of an initial affinity chromatography using M1-resin (immobilized anti-Flag antibody; Sigma Aldrich), followed by an alprenolol-sepharose affinity column.
0019
for 30 min), and soluble extracts were immunoprecipitated using 30 μl ProteinG Sepharose and the respective PDE4 subtype, or PDE4D splice variant antibodies, as well as IgG as a control. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the resin was washed three times, and PDE recovered in the pellet was detected by PDE activity assay or western blotting.

(D, E) PDE4D3, and Flag-tagged receptors, β1AR and β2AR, were affinity purified after baculovirus expression (see Supplementary Figure 1). Purified PDE and (βARs) were then combined and the βARs immunoprecipitated.
0019
At the end of incubation, cells were lysed, PDE4D5, 8, and 9 were immunoprecipitated with variant-specific antibodies, and the PDE activity recovered in the IP pellet was measured.
0019
(A, B) Neonatal cardiac myocytes expressing a Flag-tagged β1AR were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine before cell lysis and IP with M1 (α-Flag) resin.

0019
(E, F) Neonatal cardiac myocytes coexpressing a Flag-tagged β1AR and either GFP, a catalytically inactive PDE4D8 construct (PDE4D-DN; see also Supplementary Figure 5), or a catalytically inactive PDE3A1 (PDE3A1-DN) were subjected to α-Flag(M1)-IP, and the phosphorylation of the β1AR was subsequently detected in IB using a PKA-substrate-specific antibody.

We generated a model of AIRE–PHD1 complexed with the H3K4me0 peptide on the basis of the crystal structure of the BPTF–PHD finger bound to H3K4me3 and performed molecular dynamics calculations for 10 ns.
0077
Remarkably, residues G305, G306 and G313 showed strong shifts when bound to H3K4me2 and disappeared completely from the NMR spectrum owing to line-shape broadening on binding to H3K4me3, indicating an involvement of this region in peptide binding.

To obtain the p62 PH-D-bound structure of hTFIIEα AC-D using NMR, we performed NMR titration experiments in buffers both with and without 100 mM NaCl for both domains (Supplementary Figures 1–3). Although in the 100 mM NaCl buffer the dissociation constant (Kd) between AC-D and p62 PH-D was estimated from the titration plots as 376±81 nM (Supplementary Figure 1C) or 237±82 nM (Supplementary Figure 2C), the NaCl-free buffer NMR titration experiment showed much stronger binding affinity between AC-D and p62 PH-D because of the slow exchange timescale with a Kd below about 150 nM (Supplementary Figure 3).
0077
These interacting amino acids were also observed in the NMR titration experiments. In hTFIIEα AC-D, the NMR signals of E386, F387, E388, E389, V390, A391 and D392 were changed significantly upon addition of p62 PH-D (Supplementary Figure 1B) and also in p62 PH-D the NMR signals of K19, Q53, K54, I55, S56, E58, K60, A61, I63, Q64, L65, Q66, T74, T75 and F77 were changed by adding hTFIIEα AC-D (Supplementary Figure 2B).
0077
To investigate whether the STDE is involved in the binding, we prepared a longer construct (residues 351–439) containing both acidic regions and performed the NMR titration experiment under the same conditions (Supplementary Figure 4). The result was that the NMR signals of STDE showed no significant changes and the Kd of 400±43 nM was almost the same as that estimated using hTFIIEα AC-D.
0077
This is supported by the result that the binding is strengthened by removing NaCl from the buffer in the NMR titration experiments.
0077
In the binding of VP16 TAD to Tfb1 PH-D, the Kd value estimated by NMR titration experiment was ∼4000–7000 nM (Di Lello et al, 2005).
0019
The bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS–PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS–PAGE and detected by western blotting with anti-hTFIIEα rabbit antiserum (1:3000 dilution), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and anti-p53 (DO-1) (Santa Cruz) using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare).

0081
(A) Phosphorylation sites obtained from the peptide array were mutated as follows: Dead-M (S181A, S183A, S240A and S269A), Helic-M (S429A, T438A, S442A, S456A and S520A) or Pan-M (S181A, S183A, S240A, S269A, S429A, T438A, S442A, S456A and S520A).
0019
Immunoblotting showed that treating these cells with the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-benzimidazole increased the electrophoretic mobility of the MDC1 SDTD fragment and reduced the ability of the fragment to co-immunoprecipitate MRN (Fig 2E).

To examine the regions of both proteins involved in this interaction, different truncations of p30 fused to GAL4-BD domain and different truncations of hnRNP-K fused to GAL4-AD domain were tested for interaction (Fig.
0416
Nevertheless, colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm during infection was not detectable by immunofluorescence, probably because of the low relative abundance of hnRNP-K in cytoplasm and its shuttling properties which difficult its visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Two putative interactors, ADF3 (identified at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison) and AtEBP (from a yeast two-hybrid screen in our laboratory) were selected for further studies.
0019
However, this was not investigated further in this study because it did not bind ACBP4 in subsequent co-immunoprecipitation, possibly due to the absence of some as yet unidentified essential cofactor(s) for binding in an in vitro co-immunoprecipitation reaction.
0018
When Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened for interacting proteins of Arabidopsis ACBPs by the yeast two-hybrid system in our laboratory, as well as at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison, while we could not identify protein interactors for ACBP5, a common interacting protein (AtEBP) was identified for both ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004) and ACBP4.

We initially attempted to solve the crystal structure of full-length human α-parvin, but no crystals could be obtained. However, limited proteolysis led to the identification of a stable fragment, α-parvin-CHC, that readily crystallized.
0077
This phenomenon is also illustrated in Figure 5, using two diagnostic NMR signals as examples: the resonance originating from residue 257 is predicted to experience strong PRE in the forward mode (calculated distance from spin-label 10.7 Å) but should only be weakly affected in the backward mode (calculated distance 20.2 Å).
0114
We thus conclude that the crystal structures of the α-parvin-CHC/LD complexes along with the solution NMR studies presented here provide a relevant description of LD recognition by α-parvin.
0077
Small changes in a variety of factors, such as experimental conditions or the length of the paxillin fragment studied, might influence the observed binding orientation in NMR, where a mean is detected.
0114
Interestingly, the crystal structure of α−parvin-CHC presented here shows that part of the putative ABS2 region is obstructed by the N-linker helix.

For Rpb1 (BWG16 Covance), Sua7, TBP, Kin28, Tfb1, Tfa2, and Rap1 (y-300, Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitations, the antibodies were preincubated with protein A-sepharose CL-4B (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with chromatin solution overnight at 4°C. For Rpb3 immunoprecipitation, antibody (1Y26, NeoClone) was preincubated with protein G-sepharose (Amersham).

0019
The signal for each specific gene primer in the immunoprecipitation was then divided by this ratio to convert the signal to normalized units.
