The meristem-enriched cDNA library in the vector pACT2 (Clonetech) was prepared from immature inflorescence shoots (Lumbrineris erecta, 4–5 mm size) containing inflorescence and multiple floral meristems (FMs). cDNA synthesis exactly followed the manual for the cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Directional cloning into pACT2 was achieved via an XhoI site addition to the oligo-dT primer (3′) and an EcoRI adapter at the cDNA 5′-terminus. The cDNA library (1.25 × 106 clones) was colony amplified in Escherichia coli, plasmid DNA purified by CsCl2-gradient centrifugation and used for yeast transformation (strain AH109). Screening of the library followed the Matchmaker manual applying quadruple selection (HIS3, ADE2, LacZ and MEL1). In total 2.5 × 106 colonies were screened for encoded polypeptides which interact with the MEINOX-ELKSTM domain. Positive clones (223) were isolated and cDNA inserts in pACT2 were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The specificity of each protein interaction was confirmed by retransformation of sequence-verified cDNA clones (ATH1, BHL3 or BHL9) into yeast strains providing the MEINOXSTM or MEINOXBP1 bait constructs in pGDKT7. No interaction was observed with the empty pACT2 prey vector.

The ORFs of genes encoding candidate partner proteins (ATH1, BHL3 or BHL9) and STM were cloned in-frame into the transient expression vectors pUC-SPYCE and pUC-SPYNE, respectively, through the BamHI site (31), containing either the N- or C-terminal parts of the coding regions of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). As controls, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions with STM and BLH partner proteins were created in the vector pRTΩNotI/AscI (32). To create NLS-GFP-STM, a synthetic oligonucleotide providing the virD2 nuclear localization signal (NLS) (33) was inserted into a NcoI site at the translation start of the GFP ORF. For transient expression in leek epidermal cells, 50 µl of tungsten particles (1.1 µm diameter, BioRad) were mixed with 10–15 µg of plasmid DNA, 60 µl of 2.2 M CaCl2 and 20 µl of 0.1 M spermidine in a total volume of 150 µl. The DNA was precipitated on the tungsten particles at room temperature by adding 200 µl ethanol, for 3 min with continuous shaking. After brief centrifugation, the tungsten pellet was washed three times in 100% (v/v) ethanol before being resuspended in 30 µl of 100% (v/v) ethanol. Aliquots (10 µl) of DNA-coated tungsten were spotted on macro carriers and used to transform leek epidermal cells at 1100 psi rupture disc bursting pressure using a Biolistic PDS-1000-He apparatus (BioRad) The bombarded tissue was kept in Petri dishes on damp filter paper for 12–16 h in the dark and YFP or GFP fluorescence was visualized using a LEICA MZFLIII stereomicroscope.

The MACS epitope tagged protein isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to precipitate candidate partner proteins via the HA epitope. Eluted protein samples were split (1/3 and 2/3), size-fractionated in parallel on two polyacrylamide SDS-gels (concentration adjusted to protein size), electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and subjected to antibody detection. HA-tagged (1/3 aliquot) partner proteins were identified using an anti-HA horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (clone 3F10; Roche 2012819). The co-precipitated 6× his-tagged STM protein was visualized by a primary penta-His mouse antibody [α-(H)5; Qiagen 34660] and secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-mouse IGG (Dianova 115-035-062). Peroxidase activity was detected non-radioactively via chemiluminescence (ECL PLUS kit; Amersham Biosciences) and documented on Kodak-X-omat AR films. Epidermal proteins after bombardement of leek epidermal cells were isolated in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton and size-fractionated by SDS–PAGE. GFP fusion proteins were detected after transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP HRP-conjugated antibody (IgG1; Milteny Biotec 130-091-833).

As a potential transcription factor, STM was expected to direct GFP fluorescence into the plant cell nucleus. However, both fusion proteins, GFP-STM and STM-GFP remained in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B and C).
0663
The cytoplasmic retention of the chimeric GFP-STM protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of nuclei with propidium iodide. The comparison of a median Z-stack projection through the nucleus either analysed for GFP-STM fluorescence (Figure 1F), the corresponding propidium iodine stains (Figure 1G) and their overlay in Figure 1H confirm exclusion of GFP fluorescence from the nuclear compartment.
0007
In addition to the interactions in yeast, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope-tagged full-length proteins. The HA-tagged BLH proteins shown in Figure 2B were used to co-precipitate epitope-tagged STM-His (Figure 2C). The detection of the STM-His protein was strictly dependent on the presence of BLH partner proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments therefore confirm that the full-length STM protein interacts with full-length ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 proteins in vitro and substantiate the affinity of BLH/STM interactions.

In the multimeric complexes involved in animal patterning processes, PBX proteins reportedly interact with transcriptional corepressors such as histone-deacetylases or N-CoR/SMRT (50). Recent data demonstrate that PBC/MEIS heterodimers penetrate repressive chromatin to mark specific genes for activation e.g. by myoD (44). The finding that dominant mutations in the miRNA target site of PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA, which effect adaxial/abaxial patterning of the Arabidopsis leaf correlate with changes of DNA methylation outside the SAM (51) or that the floral repressor FLC is prone to epigenetic silencing by histone methylation (52) indicates that chromatin changes accompany developmental decisions such as primordial cell fate or flowering time in plants. An extant aspect of STM/BLH function thus could be the activation or the repression of transcriptionally competent chromatin. According to their transcription patterns, STM could account for qualitative differences between meristematic and primordial cells whereas BLH partner proteins could implement positional cues from the center to the SAM periphery.

The structural information available on protein–protein interactions involving ZF domains is also limited [25]. The X-ray structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α heterodimer described here provides the first high-resolution view of a complex directly involving a member from the family of ZF domains that includes α-RIMs and other Rab effectors. The structure shows that two surfaces at opposite sides of the RIM2α ZF domain interact with two different structural motifs of Munc13–13–150. Thus, the N-terminal loop region of the RIM2α ZF domain binds to the tip of the C2A-domain β-sandwich, whereas the crevice formed by the C-terminal β-hairpin and helix a2 binds the C-terminal helix of Munc13–13–150. Interestingly, in the complex between the α subunit of Hif-1 (Hif-1α) and the TAZ1 domain of CREB-binding protein (a ZF domain unrelated to the RIM2α ZF domain), Hif-1α also wraps around the TAZ1 domain, interacting with surfaces at opposite sides of the domain [31]. An emerging theme from these observations is that, because of their small size, ZF domains may often use multiple surfaces to increase the affinity and specificity of interactions with target proteins, although further research will be necessary to assess the generality of this notion.

1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Varian INOVA500, INOVA600, or INOVA800 spectrometers (Varian, Palo Alto, California, United States) using H2O/D2O 95:5 (v/v) as the solvent. Samples contained 0.1 mM15N-labeled Munc13–1 fragments, alone or together with 0.15 mM unlabeled Rim2α82–142, dissolved in 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using a 4-position An60Ti rotor and absorbance optical system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California, United States). Each cell has a six-channel carbon-Epon centerpiece with two quartz windows giving an optical path length of 1.2 cm. The sample channels and reference channels were filled with 100-μl proteins and 110-μl buffers, respectively. Absorbance was monitored for each cell in 0.002-cm steps at a wavelength of 280 nm. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, 25,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm, and 35,000 rpm at 4 °C until equilibrium had been reached. After equilibrium was reached, overspeed runs at 42,000 rpm were carried out to obtain baseline values of absorbance, which were used in subsequent fits. The loading concentration of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 were 13.52 μM, 13.65 μM, 12.46 μM, and 12.55 μM in 30 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. The partial specific volumes of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 at 4 °C were calculated from their amino acid composition to be 0.7331 cm3·g−1, 0.7324 cm3·g−1, 0.7327 cm3·g−1, and 0.7170 cm3·g−1, and the calculated monomeric molecular masses are 14,856.9 Da, 16,168.4 Da, 17,821.3 Da, and 24,683.4 Da, respectively. The solvent density was calculated to be 1.005 g·ml−1 at 4 °C. Data sets were fitted to either the single ideal species model or the self-association model using Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Origin 6.03). Global analysis was applied to data sets obtained at the different rotor speeds.

Mutagenesis of residue R1161 (in α2AA and α2AAKYA, removing another conserved charged residue) to alanine significantly reduced α2 tail association with Rab21 judged by yeast mating tests and immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, F1159A mutation (α2AARA, possibly creating a conformational change) showed reduced association in the yeast assays, whereas in immunoprecipitations the reduction was not significant. These data on the mutant integrins suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain and residue R1161 of α2-integrin are important for the Rab21 association.
0006
(A) Nontransfected MDA-MB-231 cells were surface labeled with cleavable biotin and lysed immediately or allowed to internalize cell surface proteins for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed as indicated, and the Rab coprecipitating proteins were detected first with anti-biotin antibody followed by stripping and reprobing with anti–β1-integrin antibody. The quantification shows the amount of coprecipitated biotinylated protein relative to total precipitated integrin (means ± range; n = 2).
0029
In density gradient fractionations, expression of GFP-Rab21 shifted the integrins toward the denser Rab-positive fractions (Hughes et al., 2002), and GFP-Rab21 cofractionated with α2-integrin in fractions 3–9 (Fig. 3 D). A further shift in the endogenous integrin pool (to fractions 5–11) was observed upon expression of GFP-Rab21GTP, and GFP-Rab21GDP was also observed in the denser fractions (Fig. 3 D). In the lighter fractions (3–5), GFP-Rab21 and integrin were found to cosediment with the Golgi-marker GM130, whereas in the denser fractions, cosedimentation was observed with the ER marker P115 (fractions 6–8) and EEA1 (fractions 7–9; Fig. S3 A, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1). This data, together with the abundance of integrin vesicles observed in Rab21-expressing cells (Fig. 2), suggests that Rab21 targets integrins to the endocytic fraction in human cells.
0018
The α2-integrin COOH-terminal tail (28 residues) Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion (pGBKT7 vector) was used to screen a mouse E17 Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (Mattila et al., 2005). In yeast mating tests, pGADT7-Rab21 (95–222) prey was transformed in Y187 host strain and cytoplasmic tails of α2- and α11-integrin (pGBKT7-α2 and -α11) and their variants in AH109 host strain. Point mutants were generated with the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit and confirmed by sequencing. The negative and positive controls in yeast mating tests were pGBKT7-53/pGADT7-T and pGBKT7/pGADT7, respectively.

The effect of depleting RCK/p54 on localization of Ago2 was next examined by immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells expressing Myc-Ago2 and siRNAs against RCK/p54. As shown in Figure 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G, depleting RCK/p54 disrupted the cellular P-body structures. In these P-body-deficient cells, Ago2 proteins were diffused throughout the cytoplasm and no longer accumulated at specific foci (Figure 4A and 4E). This cytoplasmic redistribution of Ago2 suggests that its localization to P-bodies is driven in mammalian cells by factors such as RCK/p54.
0416
We next visualized Lsm1 and Ago2 by immunofluorescence using antibodies against Lsm1 and Myc tag and found that Lsm1 and Ago2 co-localized in P-bodies (Figure 5B). To determine the status of P-body structures and RISC localization in cells after Lsm1 knockdown, Lsm1-depleted cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. We found that P-body structures were drastically disrupted, Ago2 was diffused throughout the cytoplasm, and Lsm1 and Ago2 were minimally co-localized (Figure 5B). These results show that P-body structures were drastically disrupted and Ago2 was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm when Lsm1 was depleted by RNAi.
0416
To examine whether the P-body protein RCK/p54, also a component of RISC, is involved in siRNA-mediated gene silencing, the siRNA dose dependence of RNAi-mediated gene silencing was quantified in RCK/p54-depleted HeLa cells using a dual fluorescence reporter assay. Briefly, GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were constitutively expressed in cells transfected with reporter plasmids for enhanced GFP (EGFP) and RFP, respectively. GFP expression was silenced by treating cells with a 21-nt siRNA targeting nt 238–258 of the EGFP mRNA. The fluorescence intensity ratio of target (GFP) to control (RFP) fluorophore was determined in the presence of siRNA duplexes and normalized to that observed in control-treated cells [52].
0004
To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent (Figure 1A).
0007
To examine the RNA dependence of protein–protein interactions, TCEs (250 μg) were treated before immunoprecipitation with 0.2 μg/ul of RNase A for 20 min at room temperature. Myc-tagged proteins were precipitated by incubating overnight with polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc antibodies directly conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, California, United States).
0663
HeLa cells expressing YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2 (a, b, and c), YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2 (d, e, and f) were visualized by confocal microscopy at 24 h post-transfection.
0004
(A) Affinity-purified miRISCs associated with PCK/p54 retain cleavage activity. To purify miRISC associated with RCK/p54, magnetic protein A beads coupled with rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-Ago2, or rabbit anti-RCK/p54 antibodies were incubated with HeLa cytoplasmic extracts. After immunoprecipitation, RISC activities were analyzed by incubating the supernatant (S) or bead (B) phases with 182-nt 32P-cap-labeled let-7 substrate mRNAs having a perfectly complementary or mismatched sequence to the let-7 miRNA. Cleavage products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. CE, cytoplasmic extract; PM, perfect match; MM, mismatch.

Cells were lysed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.2% NP-40, and complete protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were resolved by standard Laemmli's SDS-PAGE (pH 8.8) unless otherwise stated. For immunoprecipitations: rat Bim antibody (Oncogene, San Diego, California, United States) was coated to goat-anti-rat immunoglobulin-agarose; rabbit Puma antibody was coated to protein A-sepharose; mouse NHE-1 antibody was coated to protein G-sepharose; rabbit Bcl-xL antibody was coated to goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-agarose. Lysates were precleared with the appropriate agarose.

The Figure illustrates superimposed elution profiles for each sample. Peaks A, B, and C had molecular masses of 25, 015.6; 25, 016.4, and 25, 017.2, respectively.
0423
We also found that MELK physically interacted with Bcl-GL through its amino-terminal region. Immunocomplex kinase assay showed that Bcl-GL was specifically phosphorylated by MELK in vitro.
0004
The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Bcl-GL recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon-plus RIL competent cells (Stratagene). Purification of the recombinant proteins was performed using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) under nondenaturing conditions according to the supplier's instructions. For confirmation of direct binding of BCL-GL and MELK, we removed GST from GST-fused BCL-GL protein using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) according to the supplier's instructions.
0007
HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected for 48 hours with 8 μg of plasmid constructs encoding Flag-tagged full-length Bcl-GL or a series of Flag-tagged partial Bcl-GL proteins (FL, N-1, N-2, N-3, N-4, C-1, C-2 and C-3) as well as the same amount of plasmid encoding HA-tagged WT-MELK, using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer as described above. The lysates were pre-cleaned with normal mouse IgG (1.2 μg) and rec-Protein G Sepharose 4B (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA) at 4°C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the lysate was incubated with anti-Flag agarose M2 gel (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 12 hours. After washing three times with lysis buffer, proteins on beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer.
0424
To use the long isoform Bcl-GL recombinant protein as a substrate for kinase assay, a set of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (FL, N-1, N-2 N-3 and N-4) expression vectors was transfected into HeLa cells, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with Flag-conjugated agarose M2 gel (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 1 hour.
0054
For FACS analysis, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with 70% ethanol at room temperature for 30 minutes. After centrifuging to remove the ethanol, the cells were treated with 0.5 ml of PBS(-) containing 1 mg/ml of RNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes followed by staining in 1 ml of PBS(-) containing 20 mg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. The cells selected from at least 10,000 ungated cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry (FACS calibur; Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA). The data were analyzed using CELLQuest software (FACS calibur; Becton Dickinson). Assays were done in triplicate independently.
0096
To investigate the biological functions of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for substrates of MELK in cancer cells by in vitro protein pull-down assays using wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK) recombinant proteins. Comparison of silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels containing the pulled-down proteins identified an approximately 30 kDa protein in the lane corresponding to proteins pulled-down with WT-MELK but not in that corresponding to proteins pulled-down with D150A-MELK (Figure 3a).
0007
To validate an interaction between WT-MELK and Bcl-GL, we constructed plasmids designed to express HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL). These plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells and the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. Immunoblotting of the precipitates using anti-HA antibodies indicated that Flag-Bcl-GL was co-precipitated with HA-WT-MELK (Figure 3c).
0007
To further determine which segment of Bcl-GL can interact with WT-MELK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HA-WT-MELK and partial Bcl-GL proteins tagged with Flag (Figure 3e). After co-transfection of plasmid clones into HeLa cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, and then immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody.
0007
(c) Interaction of MELK with Bcl-GL. Extracts from HeLa-cells transfected with HA (hemagglutinin)-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) or Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL), or a combination of these, were harvested 36 hours after transfection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibody. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis was performed with an anti-HA antibody.
0007
(f) Determination of the WT-MELK binding regions of Bcl-GL by immunoprecipitation. The HA-tagged WT-MELK and various peptide sequences of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Figure 3e) were pulled down by immunoprecipitation with Flag-M2 antibody and then immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Flag antibody. The expression of HA-tagged WT-MELK in total cell lysates was confirmed by western blotting analysis. As a control, immunoprecipitation was performed from cells co-transfected with pCAGGSn3FC (Mock) and HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) through all steps.
0419
In addition, we found that Cdk5 is involved in BDNF-induced activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42, which is essential for BDNF-triggered dendritic growth. Our observations therefore reveal an unanticipated role of Cdk5 in TrkB-mediated regulation of dendritic growth through modulation of BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation.
0006
To explore the potential interplay between Trk receptors and Cdk5, we first examined if Trk receptors associated with Cdk5 or p35. TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC was overexpressed together with Cdk5 or p35 in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed with Cdk5, p35, or pan-Trk antibody. Interestingly, all three Trk receptors were observed to associate with Cdk5 (Figure 1B) and p35 (Figure 1C), while no association was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG control. Since both TrkB and its ligand BDNF are abundantly expressed in the brain throughout development, we next proceeded to verify the interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 in postnatal brains. We found that TrkB associated with both p35 and Cdk5 in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat brain lysates (Figure 1D).
0006
TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were overexpressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated by pan-Trk antibody. Incubation with Cdk5/p25 revealed that TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, were phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25 in vitro (Figure 2A). This is in agreement with the lack of Cdk5 consensus sites in TrkA, and points to the possibility that Cdk5 may phosphorylate TrkB and TrkC at the Cdk5 consensus sites at the juxtamembrane region (Figure 1A). To examine this possibility, a GST fusion protein containing only the juxtamembrane region of TrkB was prepared.
0419
Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Since BDNF stimulation has been observed to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 in neurons [15], we were interested to delineate if Rho GTPases contribute to BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. To investigate if Rho GTPases are involved, and to identify the Rho GTPase(s) implicated, hippocampal neurons were transfected with WT or DN Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA. We found that while overexpression of WT and DN Rac1 increased the basal number of dendrites in the absence of BDNF treatment, overexpression of both forms of Rac1 abolished BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. On the other hand, while overexpression of DN RhoA slightly enhanced primary dendrites irrespective of BDNF stimulation, overexpression of both WT and DN forms of RhoA inhibited BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Remarkably, in contrast to the inhibition of BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth in cells overexpressing WT Rac1 and RhoA, BDNF stimulation of hippocampal neurons overexpressing WT Cdc42 resulted in an increase in primary dendrites, which was nearly abolished by overexpression of DN Cdc42 (Figure 6A). Our observations therefore suggest that while Rac1 and RhoA may also modulate BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth, it is the activation of Cdc42 following BDNF stimulation that most likely mediates the increase in primary dendrites by BDNF.
0419
In the current study, we demonstrated that Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 is essential for the Cdc42-dependent increase in primary dendrites triggered by BDNF, thus adding a new regulatory component to the mechanisms involved in Rho GTPase activation by neurotrophin. Although the precise downstream pathways by which this phosphorylation affects Cdc42 activation remains to be determined, our observations provide some interesting insights.
0006
For immunoprecipitation, 1–2 mg of protein lysates was incubated with 1 μg of the corresponding antibody at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Forty microliters of protein G Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-washed with 1× PBS was added and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After intense washing with the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated protein and its associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
0096
Flag-tagged protein was overexpressed in COS7 cells and the cell lysate was obtained as described above. The cell lysate obtained was incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The Flag-tagged protein was pulled down by the affinity gel, and the affinity gel was washed twice with lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM NaF [pH 7.5]) with various protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaOV, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 nM okadaic acid, 5 mM benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). One to two milligrams of proteins prepared from brain tissues was incubated with the affinity gel, and the Flag-tagged protein pulled down by the affinity gel for 1 h. The affinity gel was washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The proteins pulled down by the Flag-tagged protein were subjected to Western blot analysis.
0419
GTPase activity was measured as described [38]. Briefly, cultured cortical neurons at DIV7 were pretreated with DMSO or Ros for 30 min, followed by treatment with BDNF for another 5 min. Cells were lysed at 4 °C and incubated with Pak1-PBD agarose with constant rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The proteins bound to the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer at 4 °C, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed for bound Cdc42 by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against Cdc42 (Upstate Biotechnology). GTPase activity was quantified by densitometry analysis of the blots.

(B) Cell lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing Cdk5 and TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Cdk5 antibody and immunoblotted with pan-Trk antibody. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were all observed to associate with Cdk5.
0006
(C) Cell lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing p35 and TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and immunoblotted with pan-Trk antibody. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were all observed to associate with p35.
0006
(D) Brain lysate from P7 rat brain was immunoprecipitated with pan-Trk, p35, or Cdk5 antibody and immunoblotted with p35, Cdk5, and TrkB antibodies. Rabbit normal IgG was used as a control. TrkB was observed to associate with both p35 and Cdk5 in P7 rat brain.
0006
(F) Brain lysates from P7 p35+/+ or p35−/− mouse brains were immunoprecipitated with p35 and Cdk5 antibodies and immunoblotted with p35, Cdk5, and TrkB antibodies. Rabbit normal IgG served as a control. Association between Cdk5 and TrkB was abolished in p35−/− brain, indicating that p35 was required for the association between Cdk5 and TrkB.
0006
(A) Lysates from COS7 cells overexpressing TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were immunoprecipitated with pan-Trk antibody and incubated with Cdk5/p25 in an in vitro kinase assay. TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, were phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25.
0006
(E) Full-length TrkB WT, M1, M2, and DM were overexpressed with or without Cdk5/p35 in HEK293T cells. In the absence of Cdk5/p35, Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB (p-Ser TrkB) was not detected. Overexpression of Cdk5/p35 resulted in phosphorylation of TrkB WT at Ser478, but phosphorylation at Ser478 was essentially abolished when TrkB M1 and DM were overexpressed. IP, immunoprecipitation.

(A) Cortical neurons were stimulated with BDNF for different time intervals. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with p35 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate. BDNF stimulation for 15 min resulted in a marked increase in Cdk5 activity in cortical neurons. Quantification of the changes in phospho-Histone H1 level following BDNF stimulation was normalized to the value obtained from untreated cultures (time 0) and is shown in the histogram. *, p < 0.05.
0006
(B) Addition of Trk inhibitor K252a abolished BDNF-induced increase in Cdk5 activity. Cortical neurons were pretreated with vehicle control (DMSO) or K252a for 30 min before stimulation with BDNF for 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate. We found that K252a pretreatment markedly reduced the increase in Cdk5 activity triggered by BDNF stimulation, indicating that the induction of Cdk5 activity was dependent on TrkB activation. Quantification of the changes in phospho-Histone H1 level following BDNF stimulation in the presence or absence of K252a treatment was normalized to the value obtained from untreated cultures (time 0) and is shown in the histogram. *, p < 0.05.
0006
(C) Cortical neurons were treated with BDNF for 20 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and immunoblotted with TrkB, p35, or Cdk5 antibody. While association between Cdk5 and p35 was not affected by BDNF stimulation, association between p35 and TrkB increased following 20 min of BDNF stimulation.

GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to further characterize this interaction.

Coimmunoprecipitation of BRCA1 and PP1. HEK293T kidney cells were transfected with vectors encoding untagged BRCA1 under the control of a CMV promoter, and vectors encoding Flag-PP1α, β, γ or Flag-Laf4. (A) A western blot probed with BRCA1 shows that immunoprecipitation of protein with an antibody against the Flag-PP1α, β or γ proteins, but not Laf4, co-immunoprecipitates BRCA1 (Lanes 1A-1D). It should be noted that the band observed slightly lower than BRCA1 in lane 1D is a non-specific background band. Lanes 1E-1H show immunoprecipitation of BRCA1 using antibodies against the amino and carboxy termini of BRCA1. (B) A western blot probed with an antibody against the Flag epitope. Lanes 2A-2D indicate immunoprecipitation of the Flag-epitope tagged PP1α, β or γ or Flag-Laf4. Lanes 2E-2G show co-immunoprecipitation of Flag-PP1α, β or γ with antibodies against BRCA1, and lane 2H shows a lack of coimmunoprecipitation of the negative control Flag-Laf4 by BRCA1.
0007
PP1 has 3 isoforms encoded by different genes that are 97% conserved across their catalytic domains and distinct roles for each isoform have yet to be determined. When we coimmunoprecipitated Flag-epitope tagged PP1α, β or γ with BRCA1, we observed that all 3 isoforms interacted with BRCA1. Additionally, we have identified the functional PP1 interacting domain within BRCA1. This domain is found in other PP1 regulatory proteins, suggesting that BRCA1 may regulate the activity of PP1 and could act as a scaffold protein to promote the dephosphorylation of BRCA1 associated proteins by PP1.

Recombinant proteins of human APPL1 N-terminal fragments including the BAR (residues 5−265) and BAR-PH domains (residues 5−385) were expressed in Escherichia coli, then purified using His tag affinity chromatography.
0114
The samples were crystallized after removing the tag with thrombin, which generated a four-residue (Gly–Ser–His–Met) peptide N-terminal to the native Asp5 residue.
0104
Consistent with this, our analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) data showed that BAR-PH protein has a higher dimerization affinity in solution (kd=0.34 nM) than BAR domain alone (kd=0.13 μM; Supplementary data).
0419
Interestingly, APPL1 would bind to Rab21 in a GTP-dependent manner (Figure 4), indicating that APPL1 is an effector for both Rab5 and Rab21.
0419
GTPase binding has emerged as a major function of PH domains in addition to lipid binding (Lemmon, 2004). For example, PH domains in some guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEF) have been shown to bind directly to their cognate small GTPases (Rossman et al, 2002, 2003; Lu et al, 2004), and our data now show direct interaction between the APPL1 PH domain and Rab5. So far, only two crystal structures of small GTPase−PH domain complexes are available. One is Ran−RanBD1 (PDB file 1RRP). The interactions between the Ran GTPase domain and RanBD1 PH core domain is fairly minor, occurring between the switch I region of the GTPase (equivalent to the 40's in Rab5) and strand β2 of the PH domain. This interaction alone is unlikely to be sufficient to form a stable complex. Indeed, Ran has a long C-terminal peptide beside the GTPase domain, while the PH domain of RanBD1 has an extra N-terminal peptide. These two terminal peptides wrap around the partner proteins forming the major interaction between Ran and RanBD1. Such an interaction seems not to be required for Rab5 and APPL1, because the GTPase domain of Rab5 and BAR-PH domain of APPL1 are sufficient to mediate their interaction. The second published small GTPase−PH complex is that of Ral−Exo84 (PDB file 1ZC3). In this complex, the PH domain of Exo84 uses L1, β5, and L6 to interact with the interswitch and switch II regions of Ral forming an intermolecular β-sheet extension mediated by the PH β5 strand and GTPase β2 strand (Jin et al, 2005). Our mutagenesis analysis points to a different surface region (β3, L3, and β4) of the PH domain for Rab5 binding. Therefore, the Rab5−APPL1 interaction represents a new GTPase−PH binding mode.
0004
His-tagged proteins of APPL1 (5−265) and APPL1 (5−385) were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins in BL21 StarTM (DE3) strain of E. coli (Invitrogen), and cells were harvested after induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 25°C. The cells were lysed with lysozyme, and the lysate supernatant was purified with His-SelectTM affinity beads (Sigma). In both cases, the His tag was removed with thrombin.
0004
Recombinant proteins of human Rab5a variants (GenBank ID: NM_004162), human Rab21 (BC021901), and human Rab22a (NM_020673) fused with an N-terminal GST were expressed in BL21 E. coli and purified with GST-affinity chromatography. The sample was concentrated to ∼20 mg ml−1 and stored in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% (v/v) βME at −80°C. Recombinant protein of human rabaptin5 (551–862) (GenBank ID: CAA62580) was expressed and purified as described previously (Zhai et al, 2003); two additional point mutations, C719S and C734S, were introduced to reduce aggregation.
0663
(C) Mutational effects on APPL1 targeting to Rab5-positive early endosomes in the cell. RFP−Rab5-Q79L was coexpressed with GFP−APPL1 (full length, FL; BAR-PH domain; or BAR-PH mutant) in PC12 cells as indicated, followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Shown are typical confocal microscopic images indicating the RFP−Rab5-Q79L labeled early endosomes (red) and the colocalization of GFP−APPL1 or mutants (green) in the same cells. Scale bar, 16 μm.
0114
Structural comparison of the A-ST crystal structure with previously reported crystal structures of A, AC complex, and A-B56-C complexes [25,26,45,46] also support the conclusion that HEAT repeats 2–10 and HEAT repeats 13–15 form two relatively rigid blocks. However, there is substantial structural flexibility between these two structural blocks, due to the result of accumulative conformational changes in HEAT repeats 10–13 (Figures S1 and S2).
0004
Soluble fractions were filtered with 0.8 μm syringe filters and applied into a Ni-NTA affinity column pre-equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Target protein complexes (the Aα subunit with GST-tag and SV40 ST with His-tag) were eluted with elution buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT. Dialyzed protein was applied to a GST affinity column to remove free SV40 ST, and on-column cleavage with TEV protease was performed at 4 °C overnight. The flow-through fraction of the GST column was reapplied into the Ni-NTA column to remove cleaved His-tag and TEV protease.
0416
(B) Subcellular localization of endogenous and exogenous UXT. 293T cells were transfected with (top) or without (bottom) FLAG-UXT. Immunofluorescentmicroscopy was performed with the indicated primary antibodies.
0006
UXT was previously reported to be expressed almost exclusively inside the nucleus of most cells (Markus et al., 2002). This was confirmed in our investigation for either endogenous or overexpressed UXT (Fig. 1 B). To further substantiate its interaction with p65, an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay was applied in which full-length HA-p65 and FLAG-UXT proteins were generated and labeled, respectively, with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation. The products were mixed and immunoprecipitated with either control IgG or anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, UXT could be coprecipitated by antibody against the HA epitope but not by control IgG, which suggests that UXT indeed interacts directly with full-length p65.
0006
To address the physiological relevance of this interaction in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-UXT in 293T cells and then stimulated cells with or without TNF-α for the indicated times. The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively. There was no detectable UXT that interacted with cytoplasmic p65 in the presence or absence of TNF-α (Fig. 1 D), which was consistent with the unique subcellular location of UXT. In addition, there was only a marginal amount of endogenous p65 in the nucleus devoid of TNF-α treatment. Consequently, no UXT was coimmunoprecipitated from this nuclear extract even though there existed a large amount of UXT. In contrast, there exhibited a strong interaction between nuclear p65 and UXT upon TNF-α stimulation. Furthermore, we tested whether endogenous UXT and p65 could interact in response to TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 1 E, endogenous UXT was coimmunoprecipitated by p65 antibody from cells treated with TNF-α. In contrast, UXT was barely detected in the immunoprecipitates without TNF-α treatment. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that only after p65 translocation into the nucleus could UXT have access to p65. However, we could not formally rule out the possibility that posttranslational modifications of either protein were prerequisites for this interaction in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that UXT interacts in vivo with p65 upon TNF-α stimulation.
0416
Alternatively, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to support this speculation. Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65. Approximately 90% of control cells displayed p65 inside the nucleus upon stimulation, whereas only 35–50% displayed p65 in the case of the UXT knockdown specimen (Fig. 5 E).
0412
(C) 293T cells were induced by 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with the indicated antibodies to perform EMSA supershift assays.
0889
For example, p300/CBP played a major role in the acetylation of p65 in vivo (Chen et al., 2002). Conversely, acetylated p65 was subjected to deacetylation by HDAC3 (Chen et al., 2001). Recent work also revealed that SIRT1 physically interacted with p65 and promoted p65 deacetylation (Yeung et al., 2004).
0007
To probe for a possible signaling complex including the β1AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged β1AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag. A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the β1AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (Figure 1A).
0007
(B) Co-IP of β1AR and PDE activity from cardiomyocytes deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, or PDE4D, and wild-type controls.
0007
(A, B) Co-IP of exogenous β1AR and Myc-tagged PDE4D splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells. The efficiency with which β1AR pulls down the different PDE4D splice variants is quantified in (B). (C) Shown is the co-IP of exogenous β1AR and PDE4D8-Myc from extracts of MEFs derived from mice deficient in β-arrestin 1 and 2 (βarr1/2KO) or from wild-type controls (WT-MEF). (D, E) PDE4D3, and Flag-tagged receptors, β1AR and β2AR, were affinity purified after baculovirus expression (see Supplementary Figure 1). Purified PDE and (βARs) were then combined and the βARs immunoprecipitated.
0007
(A, B) Neonatal cardiac myocytes expressing a Flag-tagged β1AR were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine before cell lysis and IP with M1 (α-Flag) resin. The effect of a 5 min pre-treatment with 10 μM of the PDE4-specific inhibitor, Rolipram, or the PDE3-selective inhibitor, Cilostamide, on PKA-phosphorylation of the β1AR is detected in IBs using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (C, D) MEFs derived from mice deficient in PDE4D or wild-type controls were infected with adenovirus to express a Flag-tagged β1AR construct. At 40 h post-infection, cells were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine (NorEpi) before cell lysis and IP with M1 (α-Flag) resin. PKA-phosphorylation of the β1AR is detected in IB using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (E, F) Neonatal cardiac myocytes coexpressing a Flag-tagged β1AR and either GFP, a catalytically inactive PDE4D8 construct (PDE4D-DN; see also Supplementary Figure 5), or a catalytically inactive PDE3A1 (PDE3A1-DN) were subjected to α-Flag(M1)-IP, and the phosphorylation of the β1AR was subsequently detected in IB using a PKA-substrate-specific antibody.
0019
It remains to be determined to what extent PDE4D9, which is activated after both β1AR and β2AR stimulation (Figure 5) and which also showed interaction with β1AR in co-IPs of exogenous proteins (Figure 3A and B), can substitute for interaction with the βARs in vivo.
0017
The greater binding affinity of AIRE–PHD1 for H3K4me0 peptides was confirmed by both tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), yielding dissociation constants of ∼4 μM, ∼20 μM and >0.5 mM for H3K4me0, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively (supplementary Fig S2C online; Table 1).
0017
In agreement with the GST fusion pull-down experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy showed no binding of H3K4me0 to AIRE–PHD1 containing the APECED-causing C311Y mutation (Bjorses et al, 2000). Nevertheless, a second pathological mutant, V301M (Soderbergh et al, 2000), was still able to bind to H3K4me0, indicating that this mutation is not located in the H3 interaction site (Table 1).
0017
Indeed, fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC assays showed that the alanine mutations R2A in the H3 peptide and D312A in AIRE–PHD1 markedly reduced the binding affinity (Table 1; Fig 4C) without affecting the protein fold (supplementary Fig S3 online).
0017
Similarly, pull-down experiments with whole histones and the H3K4me0 peptide, together with fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC measurements performed on AIRE–PHD1-D297A showed reduced binding (Table 1; Fig 4).
0077
The model of AIRE–PHD1 complexed with H3K4me0 was in perfect agreement with the experimental chemical shift perturbation data, as the peptide-binding region coincided with the binding surface identified by NMR spectroscopy (Fig 3A). In fact, the H3K4me0 peptide induced chemical shift changes in AIRE–PHD1 residues that map only on one side of the protein surface, involving residues in the N terminus of the PHD finger, the first β-strand, and the loop connecting the first and the second β-strands (D297, G305, G306, L308, C310, D312 and G313; Fig 2; supplementary Fig S5 online). A similar pattern of chemical shift changes indicated the same binding site for H3K4me1.
0019
To identify the mechanism of Plx1 recruitment to chromatin, we tested the interaction of Plx1 with the Mcm complex. We found that Plx1 co-precipitated with Mcm7 and that its binding was enhanced by activation of the checkpoint induced by pApT (Figure 5C).
0065
These interacting amino acids were also observed in the NMR titration experiments. In hTFIIEα AC-D, the NMR signals of E386, F387, E388, E389, V390, A391 and D392 were changed significantly upon addition of p62 PH-D (Supplementary Figure 1B) and also in p62 PH-D the NMR signals of K19, Q53, K54, I55, S56, E58, K60, A61, I63, Q64, L65, Q66, T74, T75 and F77 were changed by adding hTFIIEα AC-D (Supplementary Figure 2B).
0065
To investigate whether the STDE is involved in the binding, we prepared a longer construct (residues 351–439) containing both acidic regions and performed the NMR titration experiment under the same conditions (Supplementary Figure 4). The result was that the NMR signals of STDE showed no significant changes and the Kd of 400±43 nM was almost the same as that estimated using hTFIIEα AC-D.
0065
The binding site of hTFIIH p62 PH-D was localized to the second β-sheet (S5, S6 and S7), the loops between S1 and S2 and between S5 and S6 and the C-terminal H1 helix, where a substantial positive cluster is formed. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the N-terminal highly acidic tail of hTFIIEα AC-D strongly binds to the positively charged surface of hTFIIH p62 PH-D. This is supported by the result that the binding is strengthened by removing NaCl from the buffer in the NMR titration experiments.
0019
In vitro precipitation experiments demonstrated that COΔB-box was co-immunoprecipitated with GAD:COP1, whereas COΔCCT was not. Therefore, the N-terminal region containing the B-boxes is not required for interaction with COP1, suggesting that the interaction with COP1 is mediated by the C-terminal region of CO that contains the CCT domain.
0004
The transformed bacteria were cultured in L-Broth with addition of 100 uM of IPTG to induce GST-fusion protein expression. Then, the bacteria were harvested and subjected to GST fusion protein purification by Sonication and using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience).
0276
The samples were fractionated in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue.
0030
To determine whether the Bcl-XL/Bax heterodimer also prevented the subsequent oligomerization of Bax, we examined oligomerization by cross-linking. In these experiments, the cross-linker was added to reactions containing an equal amount of membrane-bound Bax in the absence or presence of Bcl-XL (Figure S3). In these reactions, membrane-bound Bcl-XL inhibited Bax oligomerization, as detected by cross-linking concomitant with inhibition of dye release from liposomes. Taken together, these results suggest that, when bound to Bcl-XL, Bax function is neutralized, both in recruitment of other Bax molecules through autoactivation and in oligomerization to permeabilize membranes (Figure 6C, step 6).
0019
(B) Bax was incubated in the presence of liposomes, tBid, and increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (A) without the addition of 2% CHAPS.
0019
(C) Bax was incubated for 2 h with liposomes (without tBid) at increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL or Bcl-XL Y101K. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as in (B).
0030
(D and E) Bcl-XL inhibits liposome-induced cross-linking of Bax. (D) Bax (100 nM) was incubated with liposomes for 2 h either alone (left panel), with 20 nM tBid (middle panel), or with 20 nM tBid and 100 nM Bcl-XL (right panel). Cross-linking with DSS was performed for 30 min at room temperature with or without 2% CHAPS to solubilize the liposomes prior to cross-linking, as indicated. Results were analyzed by immunoblotting. (E) Bax (100 nM) was incubated with or without liposomes for 2 h. Cross-linking and immunoblotting were performed as in (D).
0030
To investigate further the effects of the membrane surface on Bax and the inhibition of these effects by Bcl-XL, cross-linking experiments using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were performed. Cross-linking of Bax into higher-order structures after Bax binds to membranes has been observed previously [18].
0004
Recombinant full-length human Bcl-XL (or Bcl-XL Y101K) with no additional amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal intein/chitin-binding domain fusion and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column followed by further purification on a phenyl-Sepharose column, similar to a method described previously [7] but with a final dialysis step to remove detergents. For ΔTM Bcl-XL (and the ΔTM Y101K mutant), the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography step was omitted. Recombinant full-length human Bax and murine tBid (or tBid-mt1) with no additional amino acids were purified as described previously [7,9].
0030
DSS cross-linking was performed at a concentration of 2 mM (or DMSO control) for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linker was quenched by the addition of Tris-Cl (pH 8) to a final concentration of 20 mM. To examine the effects of CHAPS solubilization prior to cross-linking, samples were mixed with an equal volume of assay buffer or assay buffer containing 4% CHAPS, and the extent of cross-linking was analyzed.
0676
GS-TAP-tagged DDX3X, isolated by affinity purification using rabbit IgG agarose, was also recruited to the enhanceosome region upon L. monocytogenes infection (Figure 5C). This recruitment was specific because a control region (Figure 5A) could not be amplified by PCR under these conditions. This suggests that DDX3X exerts a direct effect on the IFN-β promoter.
0676
Tandem affinity purification using the GS-TAP cassette was performed as described previously (Burckstummer et al, 2006).
0416
Consistent with these data, S329/T331-phosphorylated MDC1 was detected by immunofluorescence in both control and γ-irradiated cells (Fig 2B; note the absence of staining in cells treated with MDC1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)), confirming that SDTD-phosphorylated MDC1 is present in the absence of damage and also forms IRIF.

pGBT9-p30 and unrelated control protein pGBT9-p54 were independently used as baits to screen a pACT2 cDNA library from pig macrophages in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain Y190 as previously published [18,20,21]. Yeast were sequentially transformed with bait plasmid and pACT2 library by the lithium acetate method. After auxotrophic and colony size selection, resulting clones were analyzed for expression of GAL4-dependent β-galactosidase. Plasmid DNA from those clones exhibiting β-galactosidase activity was isolated and retransformed into yeast strain Y190 with pGBT9-p30 to eliminate false positives. The sequence of inserts was determined by sequencing using specific primers and compared with the data base of the NCBI using the BLAST program. pGBT9-p30, pGBT9-p54 and pACT2-K were individually transformed in yeast and tested for β-galactosidase activity to exclude activation of gene reporter by itselves.

Colocalization of p30 and hnRNP-K in the nucleus of infected cells. Cells were infected with BA71V strain and analyzed at different times post infection by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy acquiring 0.1 μm optical sections from the Z-axis. A representative image of an infected cell at 8 hpi is shown (A). p30 was detected with a monoclonal anti-p30 followed by Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (red) and hnRNP-K with an anti-hnRNP-K specific serum followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (green). Discrete spots of colocalization of both proteins (orange) can be discerned in the cell nucleus.

We sought to establish whether the mitochondrial localized SIRT3 may also form a physical interaction with the FOXO family protein, FOXO3a, using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) SIRT3 expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody.
0006
(A) FOXO3a binds to SIRT3 in vitro. Cos-7 cells were transfected with either SIRT3 wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt) or deacetylation mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) vectors and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IPd) with an anti-Myc antibody followed by Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody. (B) HCT116 cell lysates were IPd with either an anti-FOXO3a or anti-SIRT3 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-FOXO3a antibody. (C) Mitochondrial factions from HCT116 cells were IPd with either an anti-FOXO3a or anti-SIRT3 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-FOXO3a antibody.
0006
Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde to crosslink protein-DNA interactions, sonicated, and fixed cells were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-FOXO3a antibody.

Kelch motifs, structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein kelch, allow protein folding into a cylindrical ‘β-propeller structure’ (Adams et al., 2000) forming a potential protein–protein interaction domain (Andrade et al., 2001).
0007
Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions. Subsequently, localization of ACBP4 and its interacting protein, AtEBP, was confirmed using transient expression of GFP- and DsRed-tagged fusion proteins in Nicotiana tabacum.
0018
The two-hybrid library screens were performed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPB2 [MATa ara3 his3 ade2 lys2 trp1 leu2, 112 canr gal4 gal80 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL1UAS17mers)-lacZ] (Kohalmi et al., 1998). Cotransformants were plated on synthetic dextrose agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine [SD-leu-trp-his] supplemented with 10 mM 3-AT (Kohalmi et al., 1998).
0018
S. cerevisiae strain YPB2 was transformed with bait plasmid pAT188 and transformants were plated on synthetic dextrose agar plates lacking leucine [SD-leu]. An aliquot of transformants was also tested on [SD-leu-his] medium supplemented with 10 mM 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT) because an absence of growth on this medium would confirm that the DB-‘bait’ fusion protein is unable to initiate transcription of HIS3. Subsequently, the bait-carrying strain was tested negative for β-galactosidase activity using the X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) colony filter assay. This further showed that the bait was not able to activate transcription of the lacZ reporter gene. The prey vector pBI-771, a variant of pPC86 (Chevray and Nathans, 1992; Kohalmi et al., 1998), was introduced into this strain and its inability to grow on [SD-leu-trp-his] medium supplemented with 10 mM 3-AT and its lack of β-galactosidase activity were confirmed before the bait was further used in cDNA library screening.

Tobacco leaf epidermal cells from agroinfiltration were examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) following the settings described by Goodin et al. (2002) with minor modifications. Single optical sections were scanned as resulting images for each transient expression. For each plasmid construct, 10–15 cells were imaged with similar results. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, filtered through a primary dichroic (UV/488/543), a secondary dichroic of 545 nm, and subsequently through BP505–530 nm emission filters to the photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. DsRed fluorescence was excited at 543 nm, the emission was passed through similar primary and secondary dichroic mirrors and finally through a BP560–615 nm emission filter to the PMT detector. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs GFP/DsRed were analysed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510 META). FRET measurements of DsRed emission with zero contribution from GFP, was accomplished as described by Erickson et al. (2003) using the following settings: excitation at 488 nm and emission filters, BP 505–530 nm for GFP and BP 600–637 nm for DsRed.

Arabidopsis leaves were fixed in a solution of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.5% (v/v) glutaradehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 20 min under vacuum and then a further 3 h at room temperature. The specimens were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, infiltrated in stepwise increments of LR white resin (London Resin, Theale, Berkshire, UK) and polymerized at 45 °C for 24 h. Materials for immuno-gold labelling were prepared according to the procedure of Varagona and Raikhel (1994) with the modification as described. Specimens (90 nm) were sectioned using a Leica Reichert Ultracut S microtome and mounted on formvar-coated slotted grids. Grids were incubated in a blocking solution of TTBS containing 1% (w/v) fish skin gelatin and 1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min. Anti-ACBP4 antibodies diluted 1:50 in blocking solution were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The grids were then rinsed three times, each for 5 min, in TTBS and then incubated with 10 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma), diluted 1:20 with blocking solution. Grids were rinsed three times, each for 5 min in TTBS, following by three 5-min rinses in distilled water. After being stained in 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 6 min followed by 2% (w/v) lead citrate for 6 min, the sections were visualized and photographed using Philips EM208s electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Controls were performed excluding the primary antibody.

Following agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves with both ACBP4:DsRed and GFP:AtEBP, observations were carried out by confocal microscopy using a green filter to investigate the fluorescence pattern of GFP and a red filter to visualize the fluorescence of DsRed (Fig. 2). GFP:AtEBP was located mainly in the nucleus, with some signals at the cytosol and the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). ACBP4:DsRed was localized predominantly to the cytosol, inclusive of signals detected in the cytosol surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Signals of both fusion proteins were common to the cytosol.

In FRET analysis, in cells co-expressing GFP:AtEBP and ACBP4:DsRed, not only GFP:AtEBP green fluorescence (Fig. 2D) but also ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescence (Fig. 2E), which overlapped with the GFP signals (Fig. 2F), were detected, indicating that FRET occurred between GFP:AtEBP and ACBP4:DsRed.

Immuno-electron microscopy was carried out using transverse sections of leaves of 2-week-old Arabidopsis germinated and grown in MS medium under a 16/8 h light/dark regime. Although immuno-gold labelling with the anti-ACBP4 antibodies was mostly evident in the cytosol, some signals were detected at the periphery of the nucleus, (Fig. 3B, C). In the control, when the primary antibody was replaced by blocking solution, no significant immuno-gold labelling was observed (Fig. 3D). The immunolocalization of signals at the periphery of the nucleus may have culminated from the interaction of ACBP4 with AtEBP.

In this study, GFP:AtEBP was not confined to the nucleus but was also detected in the cytosol where it could interact with ACBP4. ACBP4:DsRed, transiently-expressed in tobacco leaves, was predominantly targeted to the cytosol but immuno-electron microscopy indicated localization of ACBP4 in the cytosol with signals detected at the periphery of the nucleus, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with AtEBP.

Using NMR titrations, we have shown that this binding site interacts with all five paxillin LD motifs, exhibiting a preference for LD1, LD2, and LD4 over the less conserved LD3 and LD5. This could be due to differences in specific contacts and/or helical propensity of the latter two LD motifs.

α-parvin-CHC was purified as follows: cleared cell lysate (in 75 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) in binding buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) washed with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM benzamidine, and was eluted with 50 mM glutathione in binding buffer (pH 8.0).

To purify full-length α-parvin, cleared cell lysate in 200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 5 mM benzamidine, 2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), washed with 200 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM NaCl, and 4 mM DTT, and α−parvin was released by cleavage with recombinant human rhinovirus 3C-protease at 4°C over night.

Data were recorded on home-built or Bruker spectrometers with 11.7, 14.1, 17.6, and 22.3 T field strengths and processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995). Backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained using standard triple resonance experiments. Peptide titration experiments were performed by mixing two stock solutions (in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% D2O, and 30 μM DSS [pH 6.9]) containing 235 μM 15N-enriched α-parvin-CHC and either no or a maximum concentration of LD peptide at the required protein/ligand ratios (Figure S2). Phase-sensitive gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Kay et al., 1992) were recorded at 25°C.

Remarkably, in cells lacking Ctk1 (ctk1Δ), TBP cross-linked throughout these genes, from the promoter to the 3′-end (Figure 1B).

This observation was not restricted to TBP, with similar cross-linking patterns observed for TFIIE and TFIIH. Quantitation confirmed that TBP and Kin28 occupancy in the body of actively transcribing genes was significantly higher in ctk1Δ compared with WT cells. Spreading of Sua7 (TFIIB), Tfb1 (TFIIH) and Tfa2 (TFIIF) was also observed, although the association of these proteins with promoter regions was decreased in ctk1Δ cells (Figure 1C). TFIIB has recently been shown to cross-link with both the terminator and promoter regions of many active genes (Singh and Hampsey, 2007). This association is important for gene looping and dependent on Ssu72, a component of the CPF 3′-end processing complex (Singh and Hampsey, 2007). In accordance with this report, Sua7 cross-linked with region 7, downstream of the PMA1 poly(A) sites in a WT strain (Figure 1C). This pattern is generally maintained in the absence of Ctk1, suggesting that recruitment of TFIIB to 3′-ends is distinct from that of basal transcription factors to promoters.
0030
To exclude the possibility that the abnormal cross-linking of basal transcription factors in ctk1Δ cells was due to issues with the specific antibodies, the experiment was repeated with strains carrying TAP-tagged Tfg1, Tfg2, or Tfg3 (all subunits of TFIIF).

The UAS from all three genes show strong Rap1 cross-linking, and this signal remains appropriately localized in ctk1Δ cells (Figure 3C). In addition, neither Rpb1 nor TBP are found at the UAS region, indicating that the aberrant cross-linking that we observe in ctk1Δ cells is unidirectional along with transcription.
0030
As it is primarily the basal factors of the scaffold that exhibit aberrant in vivo cross-linking in cells lacking Ctk1 (Figure 1), we tested whether in vitro scaffold formation was affected in extracts from a ctk1Δ strain.
0006
Preinitiation complex assembly reaction was performed with 150 μg of yeast whole cell extracts from WT or ctk1Δ strains and the HIS4 template as described above. After 40 min incubation, scaffold isolation was carried out. NTPs were directly added to the reaction to a final concentration of 100 μM for 2 min without washing the PICs to initiate and allow only a single-round transcription. The supernatant was then removed and incubated with protein G-sepharose (Amersham) overnight at 4°C with anti-Rpb3 antibody in buffer E (20 mM HEPES (pH 8), 350 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20). Beads were washed five times with buffer E and loaded onto SDS–PAGE gels together with 50 mg of input material.
0007
The abnormal cross-linking of basal transcription factors in ctk1Δ cells is confirmed by independent immunoprecipitation of TAP-tagged TFIIF subunits.
