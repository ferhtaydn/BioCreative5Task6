Two gene families have been shown to play a role in the genetic regulation of longevity; the Sirtuin and FOXO families. It is also established that nuclear Sirtuins interact with and under specific cellular conditions regulate the activity of FOXO gene family proteins. Thus, we hypothesize that a mitochondrial Sirtuin (SIRT3) might also interact with and regulate the activity of the FOXO proteins. To address this we used HCT116 cells overexpressing either wild-type or a catalytically inactive dominant negative SIRT3. For the first time we establish that FOXO3a is also a mitochondrial protein and forms a physical interaction with SIRT3 in mitochondria. Overexpression of a wild-type SIRT3 gene increase FOXO3a DNA-binding activity as well as FOXO3a dependent gene expression. Biochemical analysis of HCT116 cells over expressing the deacetylation mutant, as compared to wild-type SIRT3 gene, demonstrated an overall oxidized intracellular environment, as monitored by increase in intracellular superoxide and oxidized glutathione levels. As such, we propose that SIRT3 and FOXO3a comprise a potential mitochondrial signaling cascade response pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1440</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1453</offset><text>One theme emerging over the last several years is that aging is a complex, genetically regulated cellular process 1. Genes critical to longevity have been isolated and characterized in several model systems including yeast and C. elegans 1. Sirtuin family genes first came to attention because their Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog (Sir2) was shown to regulate both replicative and overall lifespan by caloric restriction (CR) 2. In humans and mice there are seven Sirtuins, two that are located in the nucleus (SIRT1, 6, and 7), one in the cytoplasm and nucleus (SIRT2), and 3 are localized to the mitochondria (SIRT3, 4, and 5) 3. While yeast Sir2 is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase, mammalian Sirtuins have more varied targets, including either deacetylase or ADP-ribosyltransferase activity 4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2249</offset><text>It is clear that sirtuins regulate a series of essential intracellular processes that defend the cell against multiple types of cellular damage, including oxidative damage 5. These observations imply that Sirtuin genes may be metabolic guardians that could play a central role in longevity by regulating cellular or organelle renewal. That is, as cells and critical intracellular organelles slowly degrade from age related oxidative stress, Sirtuin genes may respond to this by activating signaling pathways to repair damage.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2775</offset><text>When outlining a course of investigation for the potential role of Sirtuins as organelle surveillance genes, we chose to examine the mitochondrial inner membrane protein SIRT3 for several reasons. First, it has long been suggested that the mitochondria play a role in aging and oxidative stress 6. Second, mitochondrial electron transport chains reduce of O2 to form superoxide (O2•-), leading to oxidative stress which plays a role in genomic instability and aging 7,8. Third, SIRT3 localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane is consistent with a role in monitoring and responding to conditions harmful to electron transport, activating processes to minimize mitochondrial damage</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3464</offset><text>The FOXO family of transcription factors: FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4 and FOXO6 are the human homologs of the daf-16 C. elegans gene. Daf-16 is the master regulator of dauer formation 9 and contributes to the regulation of lifespan in nematodes 10. FOXO transcription factors appear to regulate a wide range of intracellular processes including metabolism and cellular resistance to various forms of oxidative stress 11,12. It is also established that sirtuins interact with, and under specific cellular conditions, regulate that activity of FOXO gene family proteins 13,14. Thus, we chose to investigate if SIRT3 might also interact with and regulate the activity of any of the FOXO proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4151</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4173</offset><text>Cell lines and Plasmids</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4197</offset><text>HCT-116 (human colon carcinoma) and Cos-7 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A media, containing 10% heat-inactivated (56°C, 30min) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and. supplemented with penicillin (100 Units/mL) and streptomycin (100μg/mL).

It has also been shown that the well studied SIRT1 interacts with, and under specific cellular conditions, regulates the activity of FOXO gene family proteins 14,19. We sought to establish whether the mitochondrial localized SIRT3 may also form a physical interaction with the FOXO family protein, FOXO3a, using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) SIRT3 expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody. Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody subsequently showed a physical interaction between both wild-type and mutant SIRT3 with FOXO3a (Fig. 1A). To ensure that this interaction was not an artifact of the COS-7 cell line, or the transient transfection conditions, HCT116 cells, which contain undetectable levels of endogenous SIRT3 by western analysis, were stably transfected with p-myc-hSIRT3-wt, and p-myc-hSIRT3-mt SIRT3 expression vectors (Fig S2). These cells were used to determine if the FOXO3a – SIRT3 interaction occurs in the mitochondria or the cytosol. Co-IP experiments were repeated using the HCT116 SIRT3 expressing stable cell lines. FOXO3a was found to interact with SIRT3 in both whole cell (Fig. 1B) and mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 1C).

Thus, it seemed logical to propose that one function of SIRT3 may be to mediate intracellular superoxide levels. HCT116 based wt-SIRT3 or mt-SIRT3 cells were isolated and intracellular superoxide levels were estimated by DHE oxidation 8. These experiments showed that SIRT3 deacetylation mutant cells (mt-SIRT3) have significantly increased intracellular superoxide (O2●-) levels 8, relative to either vector control or wt-SIRT3 cells (Fig. 5A). Intracellular reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations were also altered in mutant mt-SIRT3 cells, relative to either vector control or wt-SIRT3 cells, consistent with a relatively oxidizing intracellular environment in the Sirt3 mutant expressing cells (Fig. 5B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>15330</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15341</offset><text>In this study, we suggest that FOXO3a is a mitochondrial protein and its function may be regulated by a physical interaction with SIRT3 in the mitochondria. This idea is based on the observations that: (1) FOXO3a is present in the mitochondria and physically interacts with SIRT3; (2) SIRT3 increases the DNA-binding of FOXO3a at two promoters resulting in an increase in gene expression; and (3) altered SIRT3 function results in altered and increased intracellular O2●-. The results of these experiments all support the hypothesis that SIRT3 may be a mitochondrial surveillance factor that detects metabolic imbalances involving O2•- production and induces specific pathways to respond to these conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16054</offset><text>While it is tempting to suggest that SIRT3 is initiating a signaling pathway in the mitochondria and sending it to the nucleus to activate gene expression via FOXO3a our results do not confirm this specific idea and the experimental assays to validate this idea do not exist. However, one possibility is that SIRT3 is both a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic protein. Several manuscripts have been published suggest that SIRT3 is a mitochondrial protein 21,22 while others imply a more complex cellular localization pattern 24,25. In our two model systems using HCT116 and SIRT3 knockout derived MEFs, SIRT3 appears present only in the mitochondria. However, this does not rule out a small amount of the protein might be in either the cytoplasm or nucleus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16809</offset><text>Several previous publications suggest that SIRT3 may play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism 26 as well as acetyl-CoA synthetase acetylation 4. It also appears that SIRT3 is the primary mammalian Sir2 homolog that regulates global mitochondrial lysine acetylation 1. However, the mechanism and physiological function of SIRT3 has not been determined. The results presented here, when coupled with others, suggest that at least one function of SIRT3 serves as a sensor of small reactive oxygen molecules and initiates specific cellular signaling pathways. In this model the induction of SCO2 and MnSOD would be an appropriate response to detoxification O2•-.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17487</offset><text>The mitochondria are key organelles that maintain multiple cellular processes and decreases in function are critical to age-related diseases such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and carcinogenesis 27. SIRT3 is located near the electron transport chain 28 and is at an ideal location to function as a guardian gene against the accumulation of small reactive molecules that might induce cellular damages. Mitochondria are a major source of superoxide formed by the reduction of oxygen during electron transport. The oxidative damage caused by the reactive oxygen species derived from superoxide is believed to be a major cause of degenerative diseases associated with aging 22. However, it has also been suggested that that physiological levels of O2•- and H2O2 production are essential for normal biological signaling processes leading to the attainment of a normal lifespan 26. Thus, these results suggest a potential mechanism where the normal production of reactive oxygen species, such as O2●-, induces specific pathways that act to repair and, perhaps more importantly, to renew organelle functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18595</offset><text>On the other hand, the induction of proteins such as SCO2, should decrease O2•- levels indirectly by increasing the efficiency of the four electron reduction of O2. SCO2 is a mitochondrial membrane-bound protein involved in copper supply for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) 29. CcO catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to H2O and couples this reduction with proton translocation across the inner membrane to improve mitochondrial respiration efficiency 30. CcO increases the efficiency of four electron transfer to O2 to 2H2O in Complex IV and as such, reduces the residence time of electrons at upstream sites capable of mediating one electron reductions of O2. Thus, the induction of SCO2 could theoretically decrease O2•- production at sites in the electron transport chains upstream of Complex IV (Complexes I, II, and III).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19460</offset><text>This work also suggests that there may be mitochondrial surveillance genes that sense organelle distress and pass signals to the nucleus to initiate the expression of nuclear genes to prevent or repair any functional damage to mitochondria. While no direct mechanism is presented for how this signaling is transduced out of the mitochondria, it does seem logical that such a reparative pathway would exist and has been proposed by others 27. Finally, since SIRT3 is the primary deacetylase in the mitochondria 1 we would propose that deacetylation, perhaps induced by nutrient deprivation or oxidative stress, may activate families of evolutionary conserved reparative genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>20136</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon
