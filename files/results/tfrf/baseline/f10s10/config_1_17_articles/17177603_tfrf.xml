We have previously demonstrated, using a mouse cancer model, that oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibition of DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation tightly correlates with T cell transformation in vivo, although the pathway to Bcl-xL deamidation remains unknown and its functional consequences unclear. We show here that rBcl-xL deamidation generates an iso-Asp52/iso-Asp66 species that is unable to sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim and Puma. DNA damage in thymocytes results in increased expression of the NHE-1 Na/H antiport, an event both necessary and sufficient for subsequent intracellular alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. In murine thymocytes and tumour cells expressing an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, this DNA damage–induced cascade is blocked. Enforced intracellular alkalinisation mimics the effects of DNA damage in murine tumour cells and human B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, thereby causing Bcl-xL deamidation and increased apoptosis. Our results define a signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport, to intracellular alkalanisation to Bcl-xL deamidation, to apoptosis, representing the first example, to our knowledge, of how deamidation of internal asparagine residues can be regulated in a protein in vivo.

When the two types of protein are balanced, cells survive. But if the pro-survival proteins dominate, there is a danger that cells with damaged DNA will stay alive, leading to malignancy. One of the key pro-survival proteins, Bcl-xL, acts by blocking the actions of pro-apoptotic proteins. We show here that DNA damage results in an important modification of Bcl-xL. Specifically, when the amide groups are removed from two critical asparagine (amino acid) residues, Bcl-xL can no longer block pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to cell death. Surprisingly, Bcl-xL deamidation is catalysed not by an enzyme, but by increased pH inside the cell due to the up-regulation of an NHE-1 transporter that moves positive ions across the cell membrane. Indeed, artificially increasing pH causes Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis in the absence of initial DNA damage. Exploring this novel pathway may ultimately suggest approaches to cancer therapy, especially when malignant cells are resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>2725</offset><text>Until now, the mechanisms and functional implications for DNA damage-induced Bcl-xL deamidation were unknown.

Deamidation of both Gln and Asn residues in vitro can be greatly accelerated by exposure to either acid or alkaline pH, with minima in the range pH 4–6. Until recently, it was assumed that Asn protein deamidation rates in vivo were set up by a “fixed clock” that was defined only by the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins that specified the half-life of the particular Asn residue in question. However, this view has been radically changed by the recent observation that DNA damage induces the relatively rapid deamidation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-xL in an osteosarcoma cell line system [9], indicating that the deamidation “clock”, far from being fixed, is a dynamic process that can be regulated in vivo by biologically critical events. Bcl-xL deamidation in response to DNA damage occurs at two internal Asn residues (Asn52 and Asn66), causing a characteristic retardation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis (PAGE) gels [9–12]. Initial work from the Weintraub laboratory suggested that when Asn52 and Asn66 are both mutated to Asp, then Bcl-xL loses its ability to bind to the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bim, thereby providing a putative linkage between DNA damage and apoptosis [9]. However, a secondary mutation was later identified, which, when corrected, enabled the N52D/N66D Bcl-xL to bind Bim, casting doubt on this interpretation [13].</text><annotation id="5"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="4100" length="613"/><text>Until recently, it was assumed that Asn protein deamidation rates in vivo were set up by a “fixed clock” that was defined only by the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins that specified the half-life of the particular Asn residue in question.

Our transgenic mouse model of T cell lymphoma was generated by crossing mice lacking expression of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase with a line expressing a nononcogenic level of the mutant lckF505 tyrosine kinase [16]. All the CD45−/−lckF505 progeny develop aggressive T cell lymphomas at the early CD4−CD8− stage of thymic development, typically at 5–12 wk of age. The absence of CD45-mediated dephosphorylation results in hyperphosphorylation of positive regulatory p56lck pTyr-394, causing hyperactivation of the kinase and triggering oncogenesis [15]. The model enables the investigation of the earliest oncogenic events in primary pretumourigenic thymocytes. Inhibition of DNA repair in CD45−/−lckF505 mice leads to DNA damage, genomic instability, and chromosomal aberrations detectable in primary CD4−CD8− thymocytes before transformation. Despite a normal p53 response, DNA damage–induced apoptosis is suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes, correlating with the inhibition of Bcl-xL deamidation, the preservation of Bcl-xL binding to Bim, and the inhibition of cytochrome c release and the apoptotic caspase execution cascade. Therefore, we proposed that Bcl-xL deamidation is a critical switch in oncogenic kinase-induced T cell transformation, and we suggested that Bcl-xL deamidation to an Iso-Asp52/Iso-Asp66 version, rather than the mutant N52D/N66D version investigated by the Weintraub laboratory, might be the key step in disabling the antiapoptotic functions of the protein [14,15].</text><annotation id="8"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="6377" length="290"/><text>Despite a normal p53 response, DNA damage–induced apoptosis is suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes, correlating with the inhibition of Bcl-xL deamidation, the preservation of Bcl-xL binding to Bim, and the inhibition of cytochrome c release and the apoptotic caspase execution cascade.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7053</offset><text>Neither in the osteosarcoma cell line work [9] nor in our own work based on primary thymocytes [15] has there been any indication as to how DNA damage might induce Bcl-xL deamidation. Neither have there been previous reports in the literature showing how protein Asn deamidation in general might be regulated in vivo; we address here this question. We confirm that Bcl-xL deamidation does indeed destroy its ability to sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bim and Puma, thereby establishing a clear molecular link between DNA damage, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. Surprisingly, DNA damage–triggered deamidation in primary wild-type cells is mediated not enzymatically, but by intracellular alkalinisation caused by increased expression of the NHE-1 Na+/H+ exchanger (antiport), events blocked by expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase (OTK). In the case of either murine or human cancer cells, enforced alkalinisation triggers Bcl-xL deamidation, crippling its ability to provide protection from the pro-apoptotic consequences of DNA damage, thereby indicating possible novel approaches to cancer therapy.</text><annotation id="9"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="7626" length="282"/><text>Surprisingly, DNA damage–triggered deamidation in primary wild-type cells is mediated not enzymatically, but by intracellular alkalinisation caused by increased expression of the NHE-1 Na+/H+ exchanger (antiport), events blocked by expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase (OTK).</text></annotation><annotation id="10"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0006</infon><location offset="7909" length="263"/><text>In the case of either murine or human cancer cells, enforced alkalinisation triggers Bcl-xL deamidation, crippling its ability to provide protection from the pro-apoptotic consequences of DNA damage, thereby indicating possible novel approaches to cancer therapy.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8175</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8183</offset><text>DNA Damage–Induced Bcl-xL Deamidation Does Not Depend on Mitochondrial Apoptosis</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8266</offset><text>An important consideration is whether DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation in murine thymocytes is a cause or consequence of thymic apoptosis. Figure 1 shows that whereas the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, as expected, inhibited DNA damage–induced apoptosis in murine thymocytes (Figure 1A), no inhibition of DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation was observed in cell aliquots taken from the same thymic cultures (Figure 1B). It is known that in the absence of Bax and Bak, BH3-only proteins are unable to induce apoptosis [17]. We therefore used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to deplete Bax and Bak from CD4−CD8− (double-negative, DN) thymocytes, confirmed that depletion was sufficient to block caspase 9 cleavage (Figure S1A), and showed that DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation proceeded normally in the absence of Bax and Bak (Figure 1C). We also showed that Bcl-xL deamidation was clearly detectable within 3–6 h after the instigation of DNA damage, and proceeded in parallel with increased apoptosis (Figure S1B and S1C). These results show that Bcl-xL deamidation is not caused by mitochondrial apoptosis and are consistent with a role for deamidation upstream of the apoptotic executor pathway. Further data presented below establish a more direct causal relationship between Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis in DNA damaged thymocytes.</text><annotation id="11"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="8810" length="497"/><text>We therefore used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to deplete Bax and Bak from CD4−CD8− (double-negative, DN) thymocytes, confirmed that depletion was sufficient to block caspase 9 cleavage (Figure S1A), and showed that DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation proceeded normally in the absence of Bax and Bak (Figure 1C).

However, work from the Weintraub laboratory suggests that deamidated Bcl-xL still binds Bim [13], thereby casting doubt on the model that Bcl-xL deamidation triggers apoptosis. Because the sequestration of BH3-only proteins by Bcl-xL is thought to explain its anti-apoptotic function [18], resolution of this question is clearly important for establishing a molecular link between DNA damage and apoptosis. We therefore carried out a series of cellular and biochemical experiments to address this key point.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10563</offset><text>Figure 2A shows that Bcl-xL measured in whole cell lysates from pretumourigenic CD45−/−lckF505 murine thymocytes is resistant to deamidation following γ irradiation, consistent with our previous findings [15]. Immunoprecipitation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, followed by immunoblotting for Bcl-xL, revealed that Bim sequestered only the N52/N66 Bcl-xL and failed to bind the slower migrating deamidated protein (Figure 2A, upper panel), although the amount of Bim in each immunoprecipitate was comparable (Figure 2A, lower panel). Because the BH3-only protein Puma, not Bim, plays a major role in DNA-damage triggered apoptosis [19,20], we also showed that both Puma and Bim are found in Bcl-xL immunoprecipitates from etoposide treated CD45−/−LckF505 thymocytes, whereas sequestration is ablated in wild-type cells, correlating with Bcl-xL deamidation (Figure 2B). A comparable result was obtained when Puma immunoprecipitates were blotted for Bcl-xL (Figure S2A).

Recombinant purified His-tagged Bcl-xL was exposed to alkaline conditions to cause partial deamidation and separated by anion-exchange chromatography into three peaks (Figure 2C, peaks A, B and C). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed an increase of 1 Da for peak B relative to peak A, and a further increase of 1 Da for peak C relative to peak B (Figure 2C). On SDS-PAGE gels, peak A Bcl-xL migrated slightly faster than the more acidic peaks B and C (Figure 2D), reproducing the characteristic profile of N52/N66 Bcl-xL and its deamidated versions found in our cellular studies (Figure 1B). It has already been demonstrated that these migratory shifts are not caused by phosphorylation [9,12]. In fact, deamidation of a single Asn increases protein mass by 1 Da, at the same time increasing its net negative charge, confirming that the shifts are due to deamidation. Importantly, when the three species of rBcl-xL were tested for their ability to bind to Bim in wild-type thymic lysates, only peak A bound Bim effectively, whereas binding to peak B rBcl-xL was reduced by 88% ± 2% and completely ablated using peak C rBcl-xL (Figure 2D, upper panel). Figure 2E shows that the Asp52/Asp66 version of Bcl-xL, or the Ala52/Ala66 version that cannot be deamidated, does still bind both Bim and Puma, consistent with the correction published by the Weintraub laboratory [13]. We therefore determined whether rBcl-xL Asn52 and Asn66 convert mainly to Asp or to iso-Asp upon alkali treatment. Consistent with previous results [8], Figure 2F and Figure S3 show that the ratios of iso-Asp:Asp conversion for Asn52 and Asn66 are 10:1 and 5:1, respectively.

Because protein Asn deamidation is accelerated by increased pH in vitro, we investigated intracellular pH change (pHi) as a possible regulatory mechanism in thymocytes. Figure 3A shows that after DNA damage, the pHi of live wild-type CD4−CD8− thymocytes increased to 7.55, whereas no change was observed in pretumourigenic cells. But is that increase sufficient to cause Bcl-xL deamidation? To address this question, we incubated wild-type thymocytes in the pH range of 7.2–8.0 for 20 h in the presence of the Na+ ionophore monensin to ensure complete equilibration of pHi and extracellular pH (pHe), and to neutralize acidic intracellular compartments [21], and we then assessed the extent of Bcl-xL deamidation. Figure 3B shows that whereas only 22.5% ± 3.2% was deamidated at pH 7.2, this increased to 56.1% ± 3.8% at pH 7.6 and 67.0% ± 4.5% at pH 8.0. Therefore, a rise in pHi comparable with that observed after DNA damage (Figure 3A) is sufficient to cause substantial deamidation. Furthermore, the addition of Z-VAD-fmk to thymic cultures following DNA damage did not inhibit their alkalinisation (Fig. 3C), showing that the rise in pHi is not downstream of caspase activation. To investigate Bcl-xL deamidation, pHi, and apoptosis in parallel, we manipulated pHi values artificially by incubating cells at varying pHe values in the absence of monensin. The left panel of Figure 3D shows that when DNA damage was induced in wild-type thymocytes, Bcl-xL deamidation could be largely prevented by artificially maintaining the pHi at 7.1 (value shown in Figure 3E, left panel), thereby reducing the percentage of apoptotic CD4−CD8− thymocytes by 2-fold relative to those incubated at physiological pH (Figure 3F, left panel). Conversely, Figure 3D (right panel) shows that the resistance to Bcl-xL deamidation observed in DNA-damaged pretumourigenic thymocytes could be completely overcome by artificially increasing the pHi to 7.55 or above (Figure 3E, right panel), correlating with a 2-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic CD4−CD8− thymocytes relative to those incubated at physiological pH (Figure 3F, right panel). Interestingly, enforced alkalinisation alone in the absence of DNA damage caused a marked increase in Bcl-xL deamidation in the OTK expressing thymocytes (Figure 3D, right panel), with a concomitant increase in apoptosis (Figure 3F, right panel), albeit at a level lower than with DNA damage, perhaps reflecting the somewhat lower pHi values achieved under these conditions (Figure 3E, right panel).</text><annotation id="20"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="15322" length="175"/><text>To investigate Bcl-xL deamidation, pHi, and apoptosis in parallel, we manipulated pHi values artificially by incubating cells at varying pHe values in the absence of monensin.</text></annotation><annotation id="21"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="15322" length="175"/><text>To investigate Bcl-xL deamidation, pHi, and apoptosis in parallel, we manipulated pHi values artificially by incubating cells at varying pHe values in the absence of monensin.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16686</offset><text>We considered that the tight correlation between pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis might nevertheless be coincidental and that enforced alkalinisation might be inducing apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Bcl-xL deamidation. Mutant Bcl-xL Ala52/Ala66 or Asp52/Asp66, both of which sequester BH3-only proteins (Figure 2E), were therefore over-expressed in wild-type CD4−CD8− thymocytes by retroviral transduction prior to enforced alkalinisation by incubation in media at pH 8.0 or 8.5. Figure 3G (middle panel) shows that, as expected, the Ala52/Ala66 mutant migrates as the lower nondeamidated version of Bcl-xL, whereas Asp52/Asp66 migrates as the more negatively charged deamidated version. Interestingly, in the cells expressing these mutant forms of Bcl-xL, the apoptosis induced by enforced alkalinisation was reduced 4-fold compared to cells transduced with empty vector, or more than 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type protein (Figure 3G, right panel), which of course undergoes deamidation in response to alkali treatment. These results show that Bcl-xL in a version able to sequester BH3-only proteins protects thymocytes from an enforced increase in pHi. Nevertheless, protection was not absolute, suggesting that Bcl-xL may not be the only mechanism protecting cells from apoptosis triggered by alkalinisation. As a further control, we have confirmed that Bcl-xL isolated from wild-type thymocytes exposed to a high pH buffer can no longer sequester Bim (Figure S2B), thereby mimicking the effects of DNA damage (Figure 2A).</text><annotation id="22"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="17389" length="342"/><text>Interestingly, in the cells expressing these mutant forms of Bcl-xL, the apoptosis induced by enforced alkalinisation was reduced 4-fold compared to cells transduced with empty vector, or more than 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type protein (Figure 3G, right panel), which of course undergoes deamidation in response to alkali treatment.</text></annotation><annotation id="23"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="17389" length="342"/><text>Interestingly, in the cells expressing these mutant forms of Bcl-xL, the apoptosis induced by enforced alkalinisation was reduced 4-fold compared to cells transduced with empty vector, or more than 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type protein (Figure 3G, right panel), which of course undergoes deamidation in response to alkali treatment.</text></annotation><annotation id="24"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="17866" length="156"/><text>Nevertheless, protection was not absolute, suggesting that Bcl-xL may not be the only mechanism protecting cells from apoptosis triggered by alkalinisation.</text></annotation><annotation id="25"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="17866" length="156"/><text>Nevertheless, protection was not absolute, suggesting that Bcl-xL may not be the only mechanism protecting cells from apoptosis triggered by alkalinisation.</text></annotation><annotation id="26"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="18023" length="213"/><text>As a further control, we have confirmed that Bcl-xL isolated from wild-type thymocytes exposed to a high pH buffer can no longer sequester Bim (Figure S2B), thereby mimicking the effects of DNA damage (Figure 2A).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18241</offset><text>Taken overall, these results demonstrate that intracellular alkalinisation following DNA damage is both necessary and sufficient for nonenzymatic Bcl-xL deamidation, that the oncogenic suppression of Bcl-xL deamidation in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by inhibition of alkalinisation, and that versions of Bcl-xL competent for BH3-only protein sequestration are sufficient per se to protect cells from apoptosis at alkaline pHi.</text><annotation id="27"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="18241" length="435"/><text>Taken overall, these results demonstrate that intracellular alkalinisation following DNA damage is both necessary and sufficient for nonenzymatic Bcl-xL deamidation, that the oncogenic suppression of Bcl-xL deamidation in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by inhibition of alkalinisation, and that versions of Bcl-xL competent for BH3-only protein sequestration are sufficient per se to protect cells from apoptosis at alkaline pHi.</text></annotation><annotation id="28"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="18241" length="435"/><text>Taken overall, these results demonstrate that intracellular alkalinisation following DNA damage is both necessary and sufficient for nonenzymatic Bcl-xL deamidation, that the oncogenic suppression of Bcl-xL deamidation in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by inhibition of alkalinisation, and that versions of Bcl-xL competent for BH3-only protein sequestration are sufficient per se to protect cells from apoptosis at alkaline pHi.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18677</offset><text>DNA Damage–Induced Alkalinisation, Bcl-xL Deamidation, and Apoptosis are Mediated by Increased NHE-1 Antiport Expression</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18800</offset><text>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms leading from DNA damage to the regulation of pHi and subsequent Bcl-xL deamidation. Figure 4A shows that de novo protein synthesis is essential for Bcl-xL deamidation following DNA damage in wild-type thymocytes. Because the NHE-1 Na/H antiport is a well-established regulator of pHi [22] and has previously been implicated in the regulation of thymic apoptosis [23], we measured its expression in wild-type thymocytes after DNA damage and found that the NHE-1 level increased 2.5-fold within 5 h, whereas this increase was completely suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes (Figure 4B). No inhibition of increased NHE-1 expression in wild-type thymocytes was observed following addition of the Z-VAD-fmk caspase inhibitor (Figure S4A) nor following depletion of Bax and Bak from the cells (Figure S4B). We therefore carried out a further series of experiments to demonstrate that there was a direct causal linkage between the regulation of NHE-1 expression, pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. Given that the OTK blocks DNA-damage induced NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, this provides a powerful system for examining the consequences of experimentally enforcing NHE-1 expression in these cells by retroviral transduction. As Figure 4C illustrates (upper panel), an enforced 2-fold–3-fold increase in NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, without DNA damage, restored Bcl-xL deamidation to a level comparable to that observed in a retrovirally transduced wild-type control in five separate experiments, thereby bypassing the OTK-mediated inhibition in deamidation. Overexpression of NHE-1 increased both pHi and apoptosis to comparable levels in both pretumourigenic and wild-type thymocytes (Figure 4C, lower panels). These results suggest that increased NHE-1 expression per se is sufficient to cause increased pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis. To address this question further, we used the selective NHE-1 inhibitor 5-(N,N′-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA) to block the actions of the antiport following its increased expression on thymocytes upon DNA damage. Figure 4D shows that DMA prevented the alkalinisation of wild-type thymocytes following DNA damage (top left panel), their apoptosis (top right panel), and Bcl-xL deamidation (lower panel), correlating with increased survival (Figure S5A).</text><annotation id="29"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="19059" length="1382"/><text>Because the NHE-1 Na/H antiport is a well-established regulator of pHi [22] and has previously been implicated in the regulation of thymic apoptosis [23], we measured its expression in wild-type thymocytes after DNA damage and found that the NHE-1 level increased 2.5-fold within 5 h, whereas this increase was completely suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes (Figure 4B).

We therefore determined whether genotoxic treatment in vitro of primary human B lineage CLL (B-CLL) cells might cause increased NHE-1, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis, as in primary murine thymocytes (Figures 3–5), or whether this might be inhibited, as with the murine cancer cells (Figure S7). In addition, we examined the consequences for these parameters of incubating cancer cells in alkaline pH buffers. To perform these investigations, we divided each sample of patient cancer cells into nine aliquots that were either untreated, subjected to γ irradiation, or exposed to etoposide, followed by incubation at pH 7.2, pH 8.0, or pH 8.5 for 24 h. Each aliquot was then further subdivided into three samples to measure pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. As expected, exposure of cells to mildly alkaline buffers generated pHi values that displayed some variation between samples from different patients within a narrow range. The 18 values per patient obtained from 10 different patients, the mean values calculated for each pHe value considered separately, and representative Bcl-xL deamidation results from a single patient are illustrated in Figure 6A, Figure S8A, and Figure S8B, respectively. Interestingly, unlike the murine tumour cells expressing an OTK, the B-CLL cells behaved somewhat more like wild-type thymocytes in that DNA damage at physiological pHe caused a mean increase of pHi of 0.22 units, an 8% increase in Bcl-xL deamidation, and an 18% increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Figure 6A and Figure S8A), compared to the higher thymocyte values of 0.45 pHi units, 40% increase, and 37% increase, respectively (Figure 3). The human cancer cell values for these parameters were greatly increased at alkaline pHe, generating tight correlations between increasing pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (r values shown in Figure 6A). Thus, a mean increased pHi of 0.5 correlated with 1.7-fold and 2.4-fold increases in Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis, respectively. It is also striking that enforced intracellular alkalinisation alone (by 0.3 pHi units), in the absence of experimentally induced DNA damage, was itself sufficient to increase Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis by 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively. This point is further illustrated by the gray shaded area shown in Figure 6A, which encompasses the overlap in sub-G1 (apoptosis) values that were obtained either by DNA damage at physiological pH or by enforced alkalinisation without DNA damage. Conversely, incubation of B-CLL cells at lower pH inhibited DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis (Figure 6B). Therefore with respect to enforced changes in pHi, the B-CLL cells behaved in a comparable way to both murine thymocytes and tumour cells. A small increase in pHi induced by incubation in alkaline buffer in the absence of induced DNA damage generated as much, if not more, Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis as that triggered by genotoxic attack at physiological pHe.</text><annotation id="37"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="24573" length="952"/><text>We therefore determined whether genotoxic treatment in vitro of primary human B lineage CLL (B-CLL) cells might cause increased NHE-1, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis, as in primary murine thymocytes (Figures 3–5), or whether this might be inhibited, as with the murine cancer cells (Figure S7).

This interpretation was based to a large degree on the observation that N52D/N66D Bcl-xL, one of the species generated by deamidation, can no longer exert anti-apoptotic activity nor sequester the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. However, a secondary mutation in the N52D/N66D Bcl-xL construct was later discovered, which, when corrected, restored binding, thereby casting doubt on the initial interpretation of the physiological significance of Bcl-xL deamidation [13]. We now propose that the initial finding was correct, but for the wrong reason. Our results indicate that the major Bcl-xL species generated by deamidation in situ is not Asp52/Asp66 but iso-Asp52/iso-Asp66, which is consistent with the well-established biochemistry of Asn deamidation [1], and that this species is unable to sequester Bim or Puma (Figure 2 and Figure S2). The introduction of iso-Asp into the disordered loop in which these residues are located is expected to cause greater conformational change than Asp, because of the redirection of the peptide backbone through β carboxyl groups, as indicated by the known structural and functional changes that occur in proteins upon conversion of Asn to iso-Asp residues [26,27].

To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first description of a molecular mechanism for the regulation of protein internal Asn deamidation in cells. Our results are consistent with the failure, until now, to identify genes encoding internal protein Asn deamidases [1]. The regulation of NHE-1 antiport function is complex, involving modulation of its expression, phosphorylation, and binding of regulatory proteins [24,25,31]. Our data are consistent with a model in which DNA damage causes alkalinisation by a direct 2–3-fold increase in NHE-1 expression (Figures 4B and 6C), although we cannot exclude the possibility that undetected changes in phosphorylation might shift the pH dependence of the antiport to a more alkaline range as described for myocardial tissue [32]. Furthermore, the calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP-1) has been characterised as an essential cofactor for NHE-1 in normal tissues [33], whereas its CHP-2 homologue is up-regulated in transformed cells [34], so regulation of these proteins might also be involved in activation of the antiport. Intracellular NHE-1 mediated alkalinisation has previously been implicated in the regulation of HL-60 cell apoptosis [35] and in apoptosis after trophic factor withdrawal [24]. In our present work, it is clear that the alkalinising affects of DNA damage can be mimicked simply by overexpressing NHE-1 on wild-type thymocytes in the absence of DNA damage (Figure 4C). Furthermore, either inhibition or depletion of the antiport blocks DNA damage induced alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (Figures 4D, 5A–5C, and Figure S8D).</text><annotation id="46"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="30361" length="306"/><text>We have identified critical elements in the signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to Bcl-xL deamidation in thymocytes and have shown, as Figure 7A illustrates, that deamidation is induced upon DNA damage by up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport and consequent intracellular alkalinisation (Figures 3–5).</text></annotation><annotation id="47"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="30826" length="277"/><text>Our results are consistent with the failure, until now, to identify genes encoding internal protein Asn deamidases [1].

An alternative hypothesis involves the generation of new BH3-only family members as a consequence of alkalinisation, which compete for binding to Bcl-xL, thereby displacing Bim and Puma. However, such a hypothesis does not explain why the Bcl-xL mutants that still bind BH3-only proteins retain their anti-apoptotic potency at high pH (Figure 3G).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33004</offset><text>The striking blockade in DNA damage–induced NHE-1 expression, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis noted in CD45−/−lckF505 pretumourigenic thymocytes (Figures 3 and 4), together with the reversal of this blockade by enforced expression of NHE-1 (Figure 4C), provide strong support for the model illustrated in Figure 7B. The oncogenic hyperactive p56lck-Y505F tyrosine kinase [15] must inhibit one or more steps on the pathway from DNA damage to increased NHE-1 expression, a mechanism that is under active investigation. We have previously demonstrated in pretumourigenic thymocytes a tight correlation between inhibition of Bcl-xL deamidation, resistance to DNA damage induced apoptosis, and oncogenesis, suggesting that the consequent accumulation of DNA-damaged thymocytes is critical in the transforming process [14,15]. It therefore seems conceivable that the OTK-induced inhibition of NHE-1 is likewise important in thymic transformation, and further in vivo work will be necessary to investigate this possibility.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34045</offset><text>The resistance to genotoxic attack by CD45−/−lckF505 murine tumour cells correlates, as in their pretumourigenic counterparts, with the inhibition of DNA damage–induced NHE-1 antiport expression, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (Figure S7), which is an apparent example of ”oncogene addiction”, whereby oncogene expression continues to be important for survival [36]. By contrast, DNA damage of human B-CLL cells, which should not express OTKs, triggered increased NHE-1 expression and apoptosis, achieving levels comparable with wild-type thymocytes (Figure 6C). However, enforced alkalinisation of either the murine (Figure S7) or human (Figure 6) cancer cells triggered significant increases in Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis, even in the absence of genotoxic attack (Figure 7C). In the case of the B-CLL cells, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the tight correlation observed between these events does not reflect causal efficacy, and further work will be necessary to elucidate this point. In any event, the key issue for cancer cell therapy in this context is not whether inhibition of Bcl-xL deamidation is involved in the initial transforming process, but whether Bcl-xL is the main prosurvival protein protecting the tumour cells from the normal consequences of DNA damage. An extensive literature suggests that Bcl-xL does indeed play this role in many tumour types [37]. For example, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL promoted the apoptosis of KARPAS-299 cells derived from a patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma [38], and down-regulation of Bcl-xL suppresses the tumourigenic potential of the causative NPM-ALK oncogenic fusion protein in vivo [39]. Knockdown of Bcl-xL also significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α)– and TNF-α - related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis by antitumour drugs [40]. Furthermore, Bcl-xL deamidation is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinomas, which are highly resistant to genotoxic treatments [11]. Our findings therefore have potential relevance to cancer therapy, whereby enforced alkalinisation, perhaps by amplification of NHE-1 expression, would promote Bcl-xL deamidation, thereby triggering apoptosis.</text><annotation id="53"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0426</infon><location offset="34045" length="1023"/><text>The resistance to genotoxic attack by CD45−/−lckF505 murine tumour cells correlates, as in their pretumourigenic counterparts, with the inhibition of DNA damage–induced NHE-1 antiport expression, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (Figure S7), which is an apparent example of ”oncogene addiction”, whereby oncogene expression continues to be important for survival [36].

The sequences of the inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transfected into φNX cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Viral infection of CD4−CD8− thymocytes was performed by spinoculation (1,200 g for 90 min at 30 °C). To achieve high efficiency of gene transduction, the infection was repeated every 24 h for 2–3 d. GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using a FACsAria.</text><annotation id="67"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="45431" length="322"/><text>For overexpression, NHE-1 or Bcl-xL (wild-type, N52A-N66A, and N52D-N66D) cDNA were amplified with AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and cloned into Xho1 and EcoR1 sites of the multiple cloning sites of the MigRI vector [45] upstream of an internal entry site followed by enhanced gree fluorescent protein (EGFP).</text></annotation><annotation id="68"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="45431" length="322"/><text>For overexpression, NHE-1 or Bcl-xL (wild-type, N52A-N66A, and N52D-N66D) cDNA were amplified with AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and cloned into Xho1 and EcoR1 sites of the multiple cloning sites of the MigRI vector [45] upstream of an internal entry site followed by enhanced gree fluorescent protein (EGFP).</text></annotation><annotation id="69"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0054</infon><location offset="46094" length="66"/><text>GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using a FACsAria.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>46181</offset><text>Bax, Bak double knockdown.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46208</offset><text>The SureSilencing shRNA kit for Bax and Bak was purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, Maryland, United States).

The shRNA sequence for Bax is TCAGGATCGTCCACCAAGAA, and the shRNA sequence for Bak is GGGCTTAGGACTTGGTTTGTT. To enrich the cells transfected with both plasmids which express GFP, the GFP sequence in the shRNA:Bak plasmid was replaced by DsRed using the Sma1 restriction site before GFP and the Age1 restriction site after GFP. ShRNA:Bax-GFP and shRNA:Bak-DsRed were cotransfected into primary thymocytes using the Amaxa mouse T cell nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany).

The chromatographic conditions used for the separation of the peptides in the LC-MS analyses were optimised so as to resolve the Asn, Asp, and iso-Asp forms of peptides 1 and 2. The Asp and iso-Asp forms of the two peptides were identified by spiking an aliquot of a digestion mixture with Asp- or iso-Asp–containing synthetic peptides prior to LC-MS (Figure S3). The chromatograms show LC-MS analyses at time point 72 h of the rBcl-xl base treatment. For both peptides, the major deamidation product is the iso-Asp form; the iso-Asp:Asp ratios are approximately 10:1 for N52 and 5:1 for N66. The unknown peak 3 in peptide 2 could be an isomer of peak 2 or peak 4.</text><annotation id="93"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="55738" length="622"/><text>(F) Peptides SDVEENRTEAPEGTESEMETPSAINGNPSW (peptide 1) and HLADSPAVNGATGHSSSL (peptide 2), and the corresponding deamidated forms, containing the putative deamidation sites N52 and N66, respectively, were generated by digestion of rBcl-xL with chymotrypsin. The chromatographic conditions used for the separation of the peptides in the LC-MS analyses were optimised so as to resolve the Asn, Asp, and iso-Asp forms of peptides 1 and 2. The Asp and iso-Asp forms of the two peptides were identified by spiking an aliquot of a digestion mixture with Asp- or iso-Asp–containing synthetic peptides prior to LC-MS (Figure S3).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>56664</offset><text>DNA Damage Causes Intracellular Alkalinisation and Subsequent Bcl-xL Deamidation</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>56745</offset><text>(A) Intracellular alkalinisation occurs following DNA damage in wild-type but not in pretumourigenic CD45−/−LckF505 thymocytes.
