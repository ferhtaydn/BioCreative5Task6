Prior to membrane insertion, hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) are prone to aggregation, and the spontaneous insertion of TMDs across lipid bilayers, even when thermodynamically favored, can be slow. Moreover, proteins containing TMDs must find their correct target membrane for insertion among the different membrane-surrounded compartments present in eukaryotic cells. To face these challenges, cells have evolved diverse mechanisms for chaperoning membrane proteins, often from the earliest stages of their biosynthesis on the ribosome to their proper destinations. Such pathways have been the subject of intense investigations and include the signal recognition particle (SRP)/Sec61 translocon system that imports secretory pathway proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Egea et al., 2005; Rapoport et al., 1999; Wickner and Schekman, 2005) and the transport inner membrane/transport outer membrane (Tim/Tom) translocases that mediate insertion of transmembrane proteins into both mitochondrial membranes (Neupert, 1997; Pfanner and Meijer, 1997).</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="1834" length="489"/><text>Such pathways have been the subject of intense investigations and include the signal recognition particle (SRP)/Sec61 translocon system that imports secretory pathway proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Egea et al., 2005; Rapoport et al., 1999; Wickner and Schekman, 2005) and the transport inner membrane/transport outer membrane (Tim/Tom) translocases that mediate insertion of transmembrane proteins into both mitochondrial membranes (Neupert, 1997; Pfanner and Meijer, 1997).</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="1834" length="489"/><text>Such pathways have been the subject of intense investigations and include the signal recognition particle (SRP)/Sec61 translocon system that imports secretory pathway proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Egea et al., 2005; Rapoport et al., 1999; Wickner and Schekman, 2005) and the transport inner membrane/transport outer membrane (Tim/Tom) translocases that mediate insertion of transmembrane proteins into both mitochondrial membranes (Neupert, 1997; Pfanner and Meijer, 1997).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2326</offset><text>Far less is known about the machinery responsible for the insertion of an important class of proteins that are anchored to the lipid bilayer by a single TMD located near their C termini. This topological arrangement allows tail-anchored (TA) proteins to be tethered to internal membranes while presenting their functional N-terminal domains to the cytosol (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001). TA proteins are found throughout the secretory pathway, in the nuclear envelope, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. Within the secretory pathway, TA proteins play diverse roles, such as enabling vesicular traffic (e.g., many of the SNAREs, which mediate fusion of secretory vesicles, are TA proteins [Beilharz et al., 2003]), aiding in protein translocation, and promoting folding or degradation of membrane proteins (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001). Secretory pathway TA proteins are first inserted into the ER membrane, and are then sorted to their ultimate destination (Bulbarelli et al., 2002). In contrast, mitochondrial TA proteins are inserted directly into the mitochondrial membrane, where they facilitate mitochondrial fission, provide key components of the translocation machinery, and act in apoptosis (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001). The membrane specificity of TA proteins is largely encoded in their TMDs and flanking regions (Egan et al., 1999). These signals, however, are not absolute, as some TA proteins, such as the mammalian oncoprotein Bcl2 (Krajewski et al., 1993; Lithgow et al., 1994), are found in both the mitochondria and the ER. Moreover, it is not well understood how targeting determinants in the TMDs are decoded by cellular machinery (Borgese et al., 2007).</text><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="2513" length="222"/><text>This topological arrangement allows tail-anchored (TA) proteins to be tethered to internal membranes while presenting their functional N-terminal domains to the cytosol (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001).</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="2513" length="222"/><text>This topological arrangement allows tail-anchored (TA) proteins to be tethered to internal membranes while presenting their functional N-terminal domains to the cytosol (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001).</text></annotation><annotation id="5"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0004</infon><location offset="2736" length="466"/><text>TA proteins are found throughout the secretory pathway, in the nuclear envelope, peroxisomes, and mitochondria.

This complex can then deliver Sec61β to the surface of ER-derived vesicles (microsomes), where upon it can undergo ATP-dependent membrane insertion. While these studies have provided critical molecular insights into the ATP-dependent biogenesis of TA proteins, they leave several important questions unaddressed. First, it is unclear how broad a role the Asna1/TRC40 system plays in vivo. Indeed, a recent report established that the cytosolic chaperone pair Hsc70/Hsp40 is sufficient to mediate efficient ATP-dependent insertion of Sec61β in vitro (Abell et al., 2007). Second, the identity of the proteins necessary for recruiting Asna1/TRC40 to the ER is unknown. Finally, it is unknown how cells ensure proper partitioning of TA proteins between the ER and mitochondria.</text><annotation id="13"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="4859" length="238"/><text>Recently, biochemical studies identified the mammalian soluble ATPase, Asna1/TRC40, as part of a cytosolic complex that interacts with the newly synthesized TA protein, Sec61β, in vitro (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008).</text></annotation><annotation id="14"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="4859" length="238"/><text>Recently, biochemical studies identified the mammalian soluble ATPase, Asna1/TRC40, as part of a cytosolic complex that interacts with the newly synthesized TA protein, Sec61β, in vitro (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008).</text></annotation><annotation id="15"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="4859" length="238"/><text>Recently, biochemical studies identified the mammalian soluble ATPase, Asna1/TRC40, as part of a cytosolic complex that interacts with the newly synthesized TA protein, Sec61β, in vitro (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008).</text></annotation><annotation id="16"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="4859" length="238"/><text>Recently, biochemical studies identified the mammalian soluble ATPase, Asna1/TRC40, as part of a cytosolic complex that interacts with the newly synthesized TA protein, Sec61β, in vitro (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008).</text></annotation><annotation id="17"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="5487" length="181"/><text>Indeed, a recent report established that the cytosolic chaperone pair Hsc70/Hsp40 is sufficient to mediate efficient ATP-dependent insertion of Sec61β in vitro (Abell et al., 2007).</text></annotation><annotation id="18"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="5487" length="181"/><text>Indeed, a recent report established that the cytosolic chaperone pair Hsc70/Hsp40 is sufficient to mediate efficient ATP-dependent insertion of Sec61β in vitro (Abell et al., 2007).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5881</offset><text>Based on a large-scale genetic interaction map of the secretory pathway, we previously suggested that three otherwise unassociated yeast proteins (Mdm39/Get1, Rmd7/Get2, and Arr4/Get3, the yeast homolog of Asna1/TRC40) cooperate to carry out a common function that strongly impacts on trafficking and, accordingly, named them Get1–3 (Golgi ER trafficking 1–3) (Schuldiner et al., 2005).

However, the full range of phenotypes that have now been reported for the respective get deletions are difficult to reconcile with an isolated defect in trafficking. These include mitochondrial dismorphogenesis (Dimmer et al., 2002) for Δget1 (Δmdm39); defects in DNA replication or damage response (Zewail et al., 2003) and V-type ATPase dysfunction (Sambade et al., 2005) for Δget2 (Δhur2/Δrmd7); sensitivity to toxic metal ions (Shen et al., 2003) and effects on protein degradation machinery (Auld et al., 2006) for Δget3 (Δarr4); and defects in meiotic spore formation (Auld et al., 2006; Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003) for all deletions in GET genes.

Earlier studies established that Get3, which, unlike Get1 and Get2, is not predicted to have TMDs, is found on the surface of the ER as well as in the cytosol. Moreover, in the absence of Get1 and/or Get2, Get3 loses its ER localization, and is found both in the cytosol as well as in poorly characterized punctate structures (Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005). Here we reveal that, rather than being membrane vesicles, these punctate structures are in fact cytosolic detergent-insoluble aggregates (Figure S3). We further show, through in vitro experiments with microsomes and proteoliposomes containing Get1 and Get2, that the Get1/Get2 complex is directly responsible for recruiting Get3 to the ER membrane in an ATP-independent manner (Figure 1).

N-terminal GFP fusion was compatible with the correct targeting of Sed5 to the Golgi in control cells (Banfield et al., 1994; Weinberger et al., 2005) (Figure 2B). Deletion of Get3 led to a large pool of soluble protein and a corresponding decrease in Golgi-like puncta containing Sed5 (Figure 2B).

Red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to Get3 (Get3-tdRFP) and GFP-Sed5 colocalized in these punctate structures (Figure 2C). Thus, in the absence of the Get proteins, a substantial fraction of Sed5 remains in the cytosol.

Consistent with this hypothesis, lowering protein levels of the essential Sed5 protein, by using a repressible tetO7 promoter (Mnaimneh et al., 2004), caused Kar2 secretion at levels that were similar to those observed in deletions of GET complex members (Figure 2E).

Following the diauxic shift, which occurs as cells exit log phase, we observed a more pronounced defect. In most cells, the majority of the protein was either cytosolic or in one or two large puncta that also contained Get3 (Figure S6).

Consistent with this idea, we observed that, when overexpressed, a subset of secretory pathway TA proteins mislocalize to mitochondria in Δget1/Δget2 strains (an example of the TA protein Ubc6 is given in Figure 4A). This effect was particularly pronounced for Pex15. In wild-type (WT) cells, this protein is thought to be first inserted into the ER, and then transported to the peroxisome via Pex19 (Elgersma et al., 1997; Hoepfner et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2005) (supported by data in Figure S7). However, in Δget1/Δget2 cells, Pex15 initially formed cytosolic aggregates (Figure S8), but, after extended overexpression, began to appear in mitochondrial membranes (Figure 4B). This suggests that, once Pex15 saturated Get3, it could insert inappropriately into mitochondrial membranes. Indeed, we observed that, in the absence of Get3, this lag phase is shortened dramatically, and Pex15 is found in the mitochondria at much earlier time points (Figure 4B). Hence, in addition to increasing the efficiency of insertion of TA proteins, recognition by Get3 represents a key decision step in defining the membrane destination of a TA protein, thus overcoming the intrinsic potential for TA proteins to spontaneously insert into a wide range of membranes.</text><annotation id="61"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="15790" length="531"/><text>The finding that Get3 is able to distinguish between TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway and those destined to mitochondria suggests that, in addition to increasing the efficiency of TA protein membrane insertion, the GET complex helps ensure that TA proteins accurately find their destination membrane.

This is consistent with an important role of the late secretory pathway in cellular copper homeostasis (Labbe and Thiele, 1999). More generally, individual TA protein mutant strains were sensitive to only a subset of the conditions. However, for every condition tested, we found a subset of TA protein deletions/depletions that fully recapitulate the sensitivities found in the Δget1 and Δget2 strain (Figure 5 shows the strains with strongest sensitivities).

The soluble cytosolic ATPase, Get3, specifically queries newly synthesized proteins for the presence of C-terminally localized hydrophobic domains. Get1 and Get2 then serve as an ER membrane receptor, which recruits the Get3-TA complex, thereby promoting the proper insertion of TA proteins into the ER (Figure 7A). Once inserted, TA proteins can then be routed to their ultimate destination within the secretory pathway. In the absence of the heteromeric Get1/Get2 receptor, TA proteins bound to Get3 fail to reach ER membranes, and are instead trapped in large cytosolic aggregates (Figure 7B). This leads to a broad depletion of TA proteins, which in turn can account for the otherwise confusing array of phenotypes associated with loss of Get proteins.

Biochemical studies revealed that the mammalian Get3 homolog, Asna1/TRC40, binds the TA protein, Sec61β, and facilitates its posttranslational insertion into ER membranes (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008). An in vivo role of Asna1 in TA biosynthesis in metazoans is suggested by the impaired capacity for insulin secretion in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants of asna1 (Kao et al., 2007). In light of our findings, an attractive hypothesis is that impaired insulin secretion results from compromised biogenesis of one or more of the SNARE TA proteins. The broader importance of the GET pathway is underscored by the finding that complete loss of ASNA1 causes early embryonic lethality in mice (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006) and arrested growth at the L1 stage in C. elegans (Kao et al., 2007). The molecular identity of the Get3 ER receptor in metazoans remains to be established. However, we find that Ysy6 translated in rabbit reticulocyte extracts inserts into yeast microsomes in a Get1/2-dependent manner, suggesting that the GET pathway is highly conserved (data not shown). Consistent with this, PSI-BLAST analysis identifies the WRB protein as an excellent and ubiquitously expressed candidate for a Get1 ortholog.</text><annotation id="105"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="27039" length="576"/><text>While the present studies focused on TA biogenesis in yeast, recent observations suggest that the GET pathway plays an essential role in TA biogenesis in higher eukaryotes.

Following sporulation, single-, double-, and triple-deletion strains of the correct genotype were chosen. For Figure 5, all strains were chosen to be Δmet15 to be isogenic with deletion strains taken from the Yeast Consortium Deletion Library (Giaever et al., 2002) or made by the DAmP method (Schuldiner et al., 2005). Deletion constructs used were pFA6-NAT and pFA6-Kan (Longtine et al., 1998) or pCG-URA (Kitada et al., 1995). Galactose (GAL) inducible strains were made on the same background as the deletions, only pFA6-Kanr-GALp or pFA6- Kanr-pGAL-GFP cassette was used (Longtine et al., 1998). C-terminally tagged Get3-GFP::His, Anp1-RFP::Kanr, and Pex3-RFP::Kanr were taken from the whole genome GFP tag library (Huh et al., 2003). The tetO7-SED5 strain was picked from the essential gene promoter shut-off collection (Mnaimneh et al., 2004). All N-terminal-tagged proteins with mCherry were created with a pFA6-based vector (Kind gift from David Breslow, University of California, San Francisco), carrying a URA3-TEF2 promoter-mCherry, and were integrated into the gene by one-step PCR-based homologous recombination, with appropriate primers that also introduced an N-terminal linker (GDGAGL) between the mCherry and the proteins. pRS315-GFPSed5 was a kind gift of Anne Spang (Weinberger et al., 2005). p416MET25-Get3-tdRFP was constructed by fusing the tdRFP (Campbell et al., 2002) open reading frame to the 3′ end of the GET3 open reading frame via an engineered NotI site coding for three alanines. For colocalization purposes, a mitochondrial targeting sequence containing RFP was used as a mitochondrial marker (kind gift of Jodi Nunnari, University of California, Davis).
