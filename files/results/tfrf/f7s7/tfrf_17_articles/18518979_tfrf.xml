The three mammalian Vav proteins (Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3) differ in their tissue distribution. Vav1 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, while Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed [1,2]. Vav proteins contain multiple function motifs and are involved in various cellular signaling processes, including cytoskeleton organization, calcium influx, phagocytosis, and cell transformation [3]. Vav proteins share a common structure, including a N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain involved in Ca+2 mobilization and transforming activity, an acidic domain (AD) containing three regulatory tyrosines, a Dbl homology (DH) domain with a conserved region that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac/Rho GTPases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP3 that enables its movement to the inner face of the plasma membrane, two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains interacting with proteins containing proline-rich sequences, and a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain interacting with proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines [4,5]. Tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor protein tyrosine kinase or cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase is required for Vav protein activation. In the non-phosphorylation state, Vav is folded, which is achieved by binding of the tyrosines in the AD domain to the DH domain and binding of the CH domain to the C1 region. Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain, the folding is opened and the DH domain is exposed. Thus, Vav protein is activated and interacts with substrate proteins, and the PH domain is exposed for PIP3 binding [6].</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0419</infon><location offset="2320" length="637"/><text>Vav proteins share a common structure, including a N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain involved in Ca+2 mobilization and transforming activity, an acidic domain (AD) containing three regulatory tyrosines, a Dbl homology (DH) domain with a conserved region that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac/Rho GTPases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP3 that enables its movement to the inner face of the plasma membrane, two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains interacting with proteins containing proline-rich sequences, and a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain interacting with proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines [4,5].</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="3382" length="120"/><text>Thus, Vav protein is activated and interacts with substrate proteins, and the PH domain is exposed for PIP3 binding [6].</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3503</offset><text>Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease worldwide and the number one cause of cancer-related death among non-smoking women in the US. The major problem in breast cancer therapy is development of estrogen-insensitive growth after hormonal therapy. Aberrant ERα activation by various mechanisms contributes to breast cancer development and estrogen-resistant diseases [7-9]. This ERα hypersensitivity can be achieved by estrogen-independent mechanisms, such as ERα phosphorylation by crosstalking with signal transduction pathways and overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator SRC3 [10,11]. Numerous studies have shown that EGFR/HER2-elicited signaling is involved in human breast cancer [9]. In addition, elevated PI3K-Akt signaling, mediated by PTEN deletion and/or mutation and PI3K subunit p110a (PI3KCA) mutation, upregulates ERα activity and is correlated with the breast cancer development and anti-estrogen resistance [12-15]. Activation of PI3K has been implicated in part because the downstream PI3K target, Akt, phosphorylates and promotes ligand-independent ERα activation [16,17]. Transgenic breast cancer mouse models have confirmed that elevated signaling in the EGFR/HER2-PI3K-Akt pathway either by targeted Akt overexpression or HER2 overexpression in breast epithelial cells induces breast cancer development [18-20]. These signaling pathways have been the targets for breast cancer therapy [7-9].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4938</offset><text>The classical ERα is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that activates transcription of its target genes in nucleus, which is known as genomic ERα activity. Recent findings revealed that the classical steroid hormone receptors also associate with cell membrane and mediate cell signaling through kinase cascade, defined as nongenomic activity [21,22]. Nongenomic ERα resides in multiprotein complexes with molecules, such as MNAR/PELP1 and src, in the cytoplasm and signals through the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells [23,24]. Nongenomic ERα signaling has been shown to contribute to estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5595</offset><text>Recently, we and others found that Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, enhances androgen receptor (AR) activity, and stimulates androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer cells [25,26]. We further showed that Vav3, as a signal transducer, upregulates AR activity partially via PI3K-Akt signaling [25]. The DH domain of Vav3 is responsible for AR activation. Vav3 also potentiates EGF activity for cell growth and AR activation in prostate cancer cells. More importantly, Vav3 is overexpressed in 32% of human prostate cancer. These findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression may be involved in prostate cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6251</offset><text>The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Vav3 in breast cancer.

Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with ERE-Luc reporter, and expression vectors ERα, Vav3*, and p85 (the regulatory subunit of PI3K) and p110 (the catalytic subunit of PI3K). As shown in Figure 5A, cotransfection of Vav3* or PI3K relative to the empty vector pHEF or pCR3.1 stimulated ERα activity. ERα activity was further enhanced in cells cotransfected with both Vav3* and PI3K. On the other hand, cotransfection of a dominant-negative Akt relative to the empty vector pCR3.1 blocked Vav3*-mediated ERα activation (Figure 5B). Next, we determined the role of endogenous PI3K in Vav3-induced ERα activation. Data in Figure 5C showed that PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin blocked both basal and Vav3-stimulated ERα activation in the absence and presence of E2. Similar results were also noted in cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown).

For instance, growth of these cancer cells, mediated by their corresponding hormone receptors ERα and AR, is hormone-dependent. Hormone ablation is common therapy for both cancers. Recurrent diseases develop hormone-independent growth. Given that steroidal nuclear receptors share many common properties, we hypothesized that Vav3 may regulate ERα activity and is involved in human breast cancer. We tested this hypothesis in the present study by examining the expression of Vav3 in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines and investigated a potential role of Vav3 in breast cancer cell growth and ERα signaling. We found that Vav3 was overexpressed in human breast cancer, particularly in the poorly differentiated lesions and in the two most commonly used breast cancer cell lines. The knockdown expression of Vav3 compromised both estrogen-stimulated and -independent growth of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, overexpression of Vav3 enhanced ERα signaling.

Vav3 is activated upon ligand stimulation of EGF, insulin, Ros, and IGF receptors and physically associates with a variety of signaling molecules, including Rac1, Cdc42, PI3K, Grb2, and PLC-γ, leading to alteration in cell morphology and cell transformation [33]. Overexpression of Vav3 leads to PI3K activation and focus formation in NIH3T3 cells [34]. In contrast, blocking PI3K activation by PTEN and LY294002 inhibits Vav3-induced cell transformation. Furthermore, it has been shown that Vav3*, a Vav3 mutant with N-terminal domain deletion including the acidic domain, is a constitutive active form and has much stronger oncogenic effect compared with that by Vav3 [30]. Consistently, we found that the augmentation of ERα signaling by Vav3 overexpression was similarly inhibited by Wortmannin and by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt. In addition, Vav3 showed a lower activity for ERα activation relative to that by Vav3*. EGF treatment significantly potentiated Vav3 activity for ERα activation. These data suggest that Vav3 is subjected to regulation by phosphorylation, most likely at the three tyrosines in the AD domain, which may cause conformation change, release the inhibitory effect of the N-terminal domain, and expose the DH domain for ERα binding.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32640</offset><text>Many coactivators of steroid hormone receptors have the LXXLL motifs, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid [37,38].

PELP1/MNAR containing the LXXLL motif interacts with and enhances both genomic and nongenomic ERα activities [21,24].

Taken together, these findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression enhances ERα-mediated signaling axis and may be involved in breast cancer.</text><annotation id="39"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0419</infon><location offset="34941" length="665"/><text>Our findings support the notion that Vav3 overexpression may play a role in breast cancer, based on the following reasons: 1) Vav3 is overexpressed and correlated with poorly differentiated tumors in human breast cancer; 2) Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs and complexes with ERα; 3) Vav3 enhances ERα activity partially via the PI3K-Akt pathway; 4) Vav3 is a protein with multiple domains and functions, including the SH2 domain interacting with receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the PH domain binding PIP3 involved in association with the cell membrane, and the DH domain involved in interaction with ERα; 5) Vav3 potentiates EGF for cell growth and ERα activation.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35751</offset><text>Data presented in this report clearly show that Vav3 is overexpressed in human breast cancer and is involved in growth of breast cancer cells and ERα signaling.
