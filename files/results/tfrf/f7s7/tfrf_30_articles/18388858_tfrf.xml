Light promotes seed germination and seedling growth, thereby ensuring that young plants are exposed to an optimal environment for photosynthesis. Photomorphogenesis also has important functions in the development of adult plants (Neff et al, 2000). The mechanisms controlling adult photomorphogenic traits such as control of flowering in response to day length are less well understood than those that occur in the seedling. However, a genetic pathway that promotes flowering of Arabidopsis in response to long days (LDs) has been defined (Searle and Coupland, 2004; Imaizumi and Kay, 2006). Within this pathway, the transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) has an important function by promoting flowering specifically under LDs. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a major regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis (Deng et al, 1992), negatively regulates CO protein abundance in the vascular tissue of adult plants as part of the mechanism by which Arabidopsis discriminates between LD and SD during flowering-time control.</text><annotation id="10"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="1982" length="483"/><text>Within this pathway, the transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) has an important function by promoting flowering specifically under LDs.

Mutations in CO delay flowering specifically under LD, whereas its overexpression from a viral promoter causes extreme early flowering under LD and SD. CO contains two B-box-type zinc-finger motifs near its N terminus and a CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1) domain at its C terminus (Putterill et al, 1995). The latter domain is plant specific, but shows similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the HAP2 subunit of the CCAAT box-binding complex, suggesting that CO might bind to DNA directly (Wenkel et al, 2006). The closely related genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) are highly and rapidly increased in expression in response to CO expression (Samach et al, 2000; Wigge et al, 2005; Yamaguchi et al, 2005). These genes encode RAF kinase inhibitor-like proteins that exert an effect as potent inducers of flowering (Kardailsky et al, 1999; Kobayashi et al, 1999). CO activates FT in the companion cells of the phloem within the vascular tissue, and FT protein is then proposed to move through the phloem sieve elements to the shoot apical meristem (An et al, 2004; Corbesier et al, 2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; Mathieu et al, 2007), where it changes gene expression patterns and induces flowering (Abe et al, 2005; Wigge et al, 2005; Searle et al, 2006).</text><annotation id="13"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="2670" length="363"/><text>CO contains two B-box-type zinc-finger motifs near its N terminus and a CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1) domain at its C terminus (Putterill et al, 1995).

CO transcription is regulated by the circadian clock so that its expression rises around 12 h after dawn and stays high until the following dawn (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001). Exposure to light between 10 and 14 h after dawn further promotes CO transcription through the activity of the photoreceptor FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) and its interacting partner GIGANTEA (GI) (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001; Imaizumi et al, 2003; Sawa et al, 2007). At the post-translational level, CO protein is stabilized when plants are exposed to light, whereas in darkness CO protein is rapidly degraded through ubiquitination and the activity of the proteasome. These mechanisms combine to ensure that a peak in CO protein abundance occurs under LDs when plants are exposed to light between 10 and 16 h after dawn, whereas under SD, when plants are exposed to darkness during this interval, CO protein does not accumulate (Valverde et al, 2004). The importance of ubiquitination and degradation of CO protein by the proteasome in these processes was demonstrated by use of proteasome inhibitors.

COP1 encodes a RING finger protein with a coiled-coil motif and WD40 repeats (Deng et al, 1992), and exerts an effect as a ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of transcription factors implicated in seedling photomorphogenesis (Osterlund et al, 2000). In mammalian and plant cells, COP1 seems to exert an effect as part of a complex that also includes DEETIOLATED 1 (DET1), DAMAGED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (DDB1), cullin 4A and RING BOX 1 (RBX1) (Chory et al, 1989; Schroeder et al, 2002; Wertz et al, 2004; Hoecker, 2005; Chen et al, 2006). However, the SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 1 (SPA) family of proteins is plant specific, related in sequence to COP1 and modulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1. SPA proteins contain a coiled-coil domain and WD40 repeats related to those of COP1 as well as a kinase-like domain not present in COP1 (Hoecker et al, 1999). Quadruple mutants in which the four SPA genes are mutated exhibit a phenotype similar to that of cop1 mutants (Laubinger et al, 2004). Furthermore, SPA1 and COP1 physically interact and SPA1 modulates COP1 activity in vitro (Hoecker and Quail, 2001; Saijo et al, 2003; Seo et al, 2003).</text><annotation id="18"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="5815" length="738"/><text>COP1 is a major negative regulator of photomorphogenic responses, so that cop1 mutants undergo photomorphogenesis in darkness in the absence of photoreceptor activation (Deng et al, 1991).

These plants are early flowering, particularly under SDs, indicating that COP1 is required for the suppression of flowering (McNellis et al, 1994). Furthermore cop1 mutants, but not wild-type (WT) plants, flower in darkness if provided with sugar (Nakagawa and Komeda, 2004). In addition, spa1 mutants flower early and SPA proteins modulate CO abundance so that in spa1 spa3 spa4 triple mutants 16 h after dawn under LDs increased levels of CO protein were detected (Ishikawa et al, 2006; Laubinger et al, 2006).

To test whether COP1 also regulates flowering from the phloem, COP1 or HA:COP1 was expressed from the SUC2 promoter, which is active specifically in the phloem companion cells (Imlau et al, 1999). The SUC2:COP1 transgene was introduced into WT Columbia plants and into cop1–4 mutants, whereas SUC2:HA:COP1 was introduced into SUC2:CO plants. SUC2:COP1 delayed flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, and of WT plants under LDs (Figure 1D–G). Therefore, COP1 exerts an effect in the companion cells, where CO is expressed, to delay flowering. However, SUC2:COP1 cop1–4 plants still flower earlier than WT plants under SDs, suggesting that COP1 expression in companion cells is not sufficient to completely rescue the early-flowering phenotype of cop1–4 mutants, and therefore that COP1 probably also exerts an effect in additional cell types to delay flowering. The observation that SUC2:HA:COP1 delays flowering of SUC2:CO plants under LDs and SDs supports the idea that the delay of flowering associated with SUC2:COP1 is at least in part caused by reduction of CO activity (Figure 1G).

Therefore, if COP1 exerts an effect to repress CO activity this should be reflected in reduced FT mRNA levels. In WT plants grown under SDs, CO mRNA is present during the night but FT mRNA is not expressed, because CO protein is rapidly degraded in the dark (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001; Valverde et al, 2004). The effects of COP1 on CO transcription and CO activity were tested by analysing CO and FT mRNA levels at 4-h intervals for 24 h in SD-grown plants of different genotypes (Figure 2A and B). In WT Columbia, CO mRNA was detected during the night under SDs, but was absent in co-10 and cop1–4 co-10 plants as expected due to the T-DNA insertion present in the CO gene in the co-10 allele (Materials and methods). In cop1–4 mutants, the CO mRNA pattern is similar to that observed in WT plants but rises earlier, appearing weakly 8 h after dawn, whereas in WT plants CO mRNA was first detected 12 h after dawn. In contrast, FT mRNA was detected in cop1–4 mutants but not WT plants, consistent with the early flowering of these mutants under SDs. Similarly, under LDs, FT mRNA levels were much higher in cop1–4 plants than in WT plants consistent with the earlier flowering of the mutants under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 1). However, under LDs, CO mRNA was consistently detected at lower levels in cop1–4 mutants than in WT plants (Supplementary Figure 1). The expression of FT mRNA in cop1–4 mutants requires CO activity, as demonstrated by the absence of FT mRNA in cop1–4 co-10 plants (Figure 2A). These results are consistent with the idea that COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs, and to a lesser extent under LDs, by repressing CO activity and thereby preventing FT expression.</text><annotation id="40"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="12126" length="128"/><text>FT transcription is activated by CO and

Therefore, whether COP1 and CO interact in vitro was tested using a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 3). COP1 attached to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD:COP1) and CO were made in an in vitro transcription/translation system and combined. GAD:COP1 was precipitated with anti-GAD antibody and CO was co-precipitated with GAD:COP1 (Figure 3). In contrast, CO was not co-immunoprecipitated with GAD alone. These experiments suggest that CO interacts with COP1 in the GAD:COP1 fusion protein. Fragments of CO were also combined with GAD:COP1 to determine which regions of CO are required for the interaction with COP1. Two segments of CO were tested: one containing the region between amino acids 107 and 373, which was called COΔB-box because it did not contain the zinc-finger B-boxes found at the N terminus of CO, and a second containing the region between amino acids 1 and 331, which was named COΔCCT, because the CCT domain near the C terminus of CO was removed. In vitro precipitation experiments demonstrated that COΔB-box was co-immunoprecipitated with GAD:COP1, whereas COΔCCT was not.

Under SDs of 8 h light, cop1–4 mutants flower dramatically earlier than WT plants (Figure 1) and CO protein was present for most but not all of the diurnal cycle (Figure 5C). CO was strongly detected soon after dawn, was absent or present at much lower abundance 4 and 8 h after dawn, and then was present strongly for the remainder of the night from 10 to 24 h after dawn. The appearance of CO protein from 10 h after dawn is likely due to an increase in CO mRNA levels, as the abundance of CO mRNA increased steeply between 4 and 14 h after dawn in the same plants used for the protein analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast, CO mRNA abundance fell between 14 and 24 h after dawn, whereas CO protein levels were high throughout this time. This comparison suggests that impairing COP1 function causes CO protein to be relatively stable in the dark. However, the steep decline in CO protein abundance between 0.5 and 4 h after dawn suggests that a second post-translational mechanism, independent of COP1, might negatively regulate CO protein levels in the morning.</text><annotation id="83"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="19105" length="199"/><text>CO mRNA shows a diurnal rhythm in abundance in WT plants and in cop1–4 mutants, therefore the diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance was tested under LDs and SDs in cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5B and C).</text></annotation><annotation id="84"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0051</infon><location offset="19105" length="199"/><text>CO mRNA shows a diurnal rhythm in abundance in WT plants and in cop1–4 mutants, therefore the diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance was tested under LDs and SDs in cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5B and C).</text></annotation><annotation id="85"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="19105" length="199"/><text>CO mRNA shows a diurnal rhythm in abundance in WT plants and in cop1–4 mutants, therefore the diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance was tested under LDs and SDs in cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5B and C).</text></annotation><annotation id="86"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="19305" length="174"/><text>Under SDs of 8 h light, cop1–4 mutants flower dramatically earlier than WT plants (Figure 1) and CO protein was present for most but not all of the diurnal cycle (Figure 5C).</text></annotation><annotation id="87"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0051</infon><location offset="19305" length="174"/><text>Under SDs of 8 h light, cop1–4 mutants flower dramatically earlier than WT plants (Figure 1) and CO protein was present for most but not all of the diurnal cycle (Figure 5C).</text></annotation><annotation id="88"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="19305" length="174"/><text>Under SDs of 8 h light, cop1–4 mutants flower dramatically earlier than WT plants (Figure 1) and CO protein was present for most but not all of the diurnal cycle (Figure 5C).</text></annotation><annotation id="89"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="19480" length="198"/><text>CO was strongly detected soon after dawn, was absent or present at much lower abundance 4 and 8 h after dawn, and then was present strongly for the remainder of the night from 10 to 24 h after dawn.</text></annotation><annotation id="90"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0051</infon><location offset="19679" length="374"/><text>The appearance of CO protein from 10 h after dawn is likely due to an increase in CO mRNA levels, as the abundance of CO mRNA increased steeply between 4 and 14 h after dawn in the same plants used for the protein analysis (Supplementary Figure 2).

Recently, CO protein was shown to be more abundant in spa1 spa3 spa4 triple mutants 16 h after dawn under LDs (Laubinger et al, 2006). The diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance in spa1–7 mutant plants was tested to compare with that described for cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5C and E). A similar pattern of CO protein accumulation was observed in spa1–7 and cop1–4 mutants between 14 h after dawn and the following morning, but the rise in the abundance of the protein was delayed in the spa1–7 mutant, so that it could not be detected until 14 h after dawn. In contrast, in the cop1–4 mutant CO protein was strongly detected 10 h after dawn. These results suggest a functional relationship between COP1 and SPA1 proteins in the degradation of CO, and that of the four SPA proteins SPA1 has the major role in regulating CO levels. The delayed increase in CO abundance in spa1–7 compared with cop1–4 mutants might be due to the activity of other SPA proteins.</text><annotation id="113"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="22830" length="134"/><text>Recently, CO protein was shown to be more abundant in spa1 spa3 spa4 triple mutants 16 h after dawn under LDs (Laubinger et al, 2006).</text></annotation><annotation id="114"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="22965" length="147"/><text>The diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance in spa1–7 mutant plants was tested to compare with that described for cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5C and E).</text></annotation><annotation id="115"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0051</infon><location offset="22965" length="147"/><text>The diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance in spa1–7 mutant plants was tested to compare with that described for cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5C and E).</text></annotation><annotation id="116"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="22965" length="147"/><text>The diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance in spa1–7 mutant plants was tested to compare with that described for cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5C and E).</text></annotation><annotation id="117"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="23113" length="272"/><text>A similar pattern of CO protein accumulation was observed in spa1–7 and cop1–4 mutants between 14 h after dawn and the following morning, but the rise in the abundance of the protein was delayed in the spa1–7 mutant, so that it could not be detected until 14 h after dawn.</text></annotation><annotation id="118"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="23113" length="272"/><text>A similar pattern of CO protein accumulation was observed in spa1–7 and cop1–4 mutants between 14 h after dawn and the following morning, but the rise in the abundance of the protein was delayed in the spa1–7 mutant, so that it could not be detected until 14 h after dawn.</text></annotation><annotation id="119"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="23386" length="83"/><text>In contrast, in the cop1–4 mutant CO protein was strongly detected 10 h after dawn.</text></annotation><annotation id="120"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="23386" length="83"/><text>In contrast, in the cop1–4 mutant CO protein was strongly detected 10 h after dawn.</text></annotation><annotation id="121"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="23470" length="187"/><text>These results suggest a functional relationship between COP1 and SPA1 proteins in the degradation of CO, and that of the four SPA proteins SPA1 has the major role in regulating CO levels.</text></annotation><annotation id="122"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="23470" length="187"/><text>These results suggest a functional relationship between COP1 and SPA1 proteins in the degradation of CO, and that of the four SPA proteins SPA1 has the major role in regulating CO levels.</text></annotation><annotation id="123"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="23658" length="127"/><text>The delayed increase in CO abundance in spa1–7 compared with cop1–4 mutants might be due to the activity of other SPA proteins.</text></annotation><annotation id="124"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="23658" length="127"/><text>The delayed increase in CO abundance in spa1–7 compared with cop1–4 mutants might be due to the activity of other SPA proteins.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23802</offset><text>Degradation of CO protein in red light is not impaired by the cop1–4 mutation</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23882</offset><text>Arabidopsis plants flower later under red light and previously this was proposed to be at least partly due to degradation of CO protein under these conditions (Valverde et al, 2004).

COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs by preventing CO protein accumulation during the night and thereby ensuring that FT transcriptional activation does not occur. Under LDs WT plants flower early, but even under these conditions COP1 modulates CO protein levels, lowering the abundance of the protein towards the end of the day and during the night. These effects on CO are consistent with the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, the largely day length-insensitive phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and suppression of these phenotypes to a large extent by co mutations. However, in cop1–4 mutants CO protein abundance is still reduced in the early morning and in red light, indicating that a second mechanism independent of COP1 regulates CO protein abundance under these conditions. The mechanism that exerts an effect in the early morning is shown to depend on the phyB photoreceptor. Our observations place COP1 within the regulatory network for photoperiod perception and regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis (Figure 7), and extend the characterized functions of COP1 beyond those previously described in seedling photomorphogenesis.</text><annotation id="137"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="24859" length="175"/><text>We demonstrated that COP1 ubiquitin ligase is required to shape the diurnal pattern of CO protein accumulation as part of the flowering response of Arabidopsis to photoperiod.</text></annotation><annotation id="138"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="24859" length="175"/><text>We demonstrated that COP1 ubiquitin ligase is required to shape the diurnal pattern of CO protein accumulation as part of the flowering response of Arabidopsis to photoperiod.</text></annotation><annotation id="139"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="25035" length="171"/><text>COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs by preventing CO protein accumulation during the night and thereby ensuring that FT transcriptional activation does not occur.</text></annotation><annotation id="140"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="25035" length="171"/><text>COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs by preventing CO protein accumulation during the night and thereby ensuring that FT transcriptional activation does not occur.</text></annotation><annotation id="141"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="25207" length="186"/><text>Under LDs WT plants flower early, but even under these conditions COP1 modulates CO protein levels, lowering the abundance of the protein towards the end of the day and during the night.</text></annotation><annotation id="142"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="25207" length="186"/><text>Under LDs WT plants flower early, but even under these conditions COP1 modulates CO protein levels, lowering the abundance of the protein towards the end of the day and during the night.</text></annotation><annotation id="143"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="25394" length="238"/><text>These effects on CO are consistent with the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, the largely day length-insensitive phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and suppression of these phenotypes to a large extent by co mutations.</text></annotation><annotation id="144"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="25394" length="238"/><text>These effects on CO are consistent with the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, the largely day length-insensitive phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and suppression of these phenotypes to a large extent by co mutations.</text></annotation><annotation id="145"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="25633" length="213"/><text>However, in cop1–4 mutants CO protein abundance is still reduced in the early morning and in red light, indicating that a second mechanism independent of COP1 regulates CO protein abundance under these conditions.</text></annotation><annotation id="146"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="25633" length="213"/><text>However, in cop1–4 mutants CO protein abundance is still reduced in the early morning and in red light, indicating that a second mechanism independent of COP1 regulates CO protein abundance under these conditions.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26209</offset><text>COP1 reduces CO protein abundance to confer a photoperiodic flowering response</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26288</offset><text>COP1 represses seedling photomorphogenesis by catalysing the ubiquitination and therefore degradation of proteins that promote seedling photomorphogenesis (Osterlund et al, 2000; Seo et al, 2003; Duek et al, 2004; Jang et al, 2005; Yang et al, 2005).

One of these occurred early in the day and involved a phyB-mediated signal and another occurred in the dark during the night (Valverde et al, 2004). Degradation of CO protein in red light was proposed to involve the same phyB pathway that caused rapid turnover of the protein early in the day. We observed that in cop1–4 mutants the CO protein was still effectively degraded in red light and that there was a strong diurnal trough in CO protein levels early in the day. Degradation of CO early in the day was shown to require phyB but not COP1. The degradation of CO in red light likely occurs by the same phyB-dependent mechanism acting early in the day, as was shown by Valverde et al (2004), and this could be tested by comparing cop1–6 phyB-9 and cop1–6 plants under red light. Also, we cannot exclude that other phytochromes related to phyB may also have a function in CO regulation. In particular, phyC and phyE were demonstrated to influence flowering time (Halliday and Whitelam, 2003; Monte et al, 2003; Balasubramanian et al, 2006). Nevertheless, our data suggest that a second ubiquitin ligase may be responsible for phyB-mediated turnover of CO early in the day and in continuous red light (Figure 7). Interestingly, the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3, which is involved in seedling photomorphogenesis and phytochrome signalling, was also recently shown to be degraded by a red light-activated ubiquitin-mediated process soon after dawn (Al-Sady et al, 2006). There might be a common mechanism promoting the degradation at dawn of several transcription factors involved in light signalling. Alternatively, a set of ubiquitin ligases might exist that specifically promote the degradation of individual transcription factors at this time. Further genetic and biochemical approaches are required to understand the mechanisms underlying CO protein degradation at dawn.</text><annotation id="170"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="30519" length="320"/><text>Degradation of CO protein in red light was proposed to involve the same phyB pathway that caused rapid turnover of the protein early in the day.

Furthermore, reducing FT expression specifically in the phloem companion cells delays flowering (Mathieu et al, 2007). Thus, the perception of photoperiod that is mediated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CO likely takes place in the companion cells. Similarly, Cry2, which positively regulates CO accumulation, exerts an effect in the companion cells to regulate flowering (Endo et al, 2007). In contrast, phyB, a photoreceptor that delays flowering at least in part by reducing CO abundance, appears to exert an effect non-cell autonomously from the mesophyll cells (Endo et al, 2005). This result suggests that a signalling step downstream of phyB exerts an effect non-cell autonomously to trigger degradation of CO protein, although definitive conclusions on the site of action of phytochromes influencing flowering will require a better understanding of the spatial requirement for other phytochromes, such as phyC and phyE. We showed that expression of COP1 in the vascular tissue from the SUC2 promoter complemented the flowering-time phenotype of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and reduced FT mRNA levels. Under SDs, cop1–4 SUC2:COP1 plants still flowered earlier than WT, but this was probably due to a CO-independent process causing early flowering in the cop1–4 mutant, because cop1–4 co-10 plants also flowered earlier than WT under SDs. In WT plants, SUC2:COP1 also delayed flowering under LDs but not under SDs. The day length specificity of this effect suggests that the overexpression in companion cells affects flowering through CO, and indicates that COP1 levels are a limiting factor on CO degradation under these conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that COP1 exerts an effect in companion cells to regulate FT expression. This observation is consistent with our suggestion that COP1 exerts an effect to degrade CO at the end of the day and during the night, but not as part of the phyB pathway, which exerts an effect mainly in the morning or in red light. The temporal patterns of COP1 activity, therefore, support our understanding of the spatial pattern of activity of the pathways responsible for post-translational regulation of CO (Figure 7).</text><annotation id="177"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="32334" length="454"/><text>CO and FT are expressed in the vascular tissue and their expression in the phloem companion cells is sufficient to promote flowering (Takada and Goto, 2003; An et al, 2004).

The proteins colocalized in the nucleus and both occurred in speckles. Previously, COP1 was shown to colocalize with its target proteins HY5, HYH and LAF1 in nuclear speckles in onion epidermal cells (Osterlund et al, 2000; Holm et al, 2002; Seo et al, 2003). COP1 speckles were proposed to represent nuclear sites for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (Al-Sady et al, 2006). The presence of CO and COP1 in nuclear speckles similar to those observed for other targets of COP1-mediated degradation supports the idea that direct interaction between COP1 and CO is required for CO degradation in the nucleus. This degradation presumably requires the SPA proteins, perhaps acting directly in a larger order complex with COP1, as SPA proteins also regulate CO abundance at least at the end of a LD and interact directly with COP1 (Laubinger et al, 2006). The mechanism by which CO is degraded by the SPA–COP1 complex has therefore strong parallels with that of HY5. However, the precise relationship between SPA1 and COP1 activity and whether the proteins exert an effect in a larger order complex that interacts directly with substrates is still not clear (Saijo et al, 2003; Seo et al, 2003; Hoecker, 2005).</text><annotation id="186"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="36130" length="156"/><text>Direct interaction between COP1 and CO was further supported by transient expression of COP1 and CO fused to fluorescent proteins in Arabidopsis leaf cells.</text></annotation><annotation id="187"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="36287" length="259"/><text>The proteins colocalized in the nucleus and both occurred in speckles.

CO activity is proposed to be restricted to LDs by an external coincidence model in which circadian clock control and light signalling combine to trigger CO activity (Searle and Coupland, 2004; Imaizumi and Kay, 2006). The cop1–4 mutant causes CO mRNA to accumulate earlier under SDs, so that cop1–4 mutations may in part accelerate flowering under SDs by causing CO mRNA to be expressed in the light, as previously shown for toc1-1 mutants (Yanovsky and Kay, 2002). However, the major time of expression of FT under SDs in cop1–4 is later during the night, suggesting that the earlier phase of CO expression in cop1–4 has a small part in the acceleration of flowering under these conditions. Rather the major role of COP1 in this system appears to be to degrade CO protein in the dark, and thereby ensure that no FT transcription occurs under SDs (Figure 7). The importance of this activity is demonstrated by the high abundance of CO protein in the cop1–4 mutant under SDs and the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under these conditions. During the final revision of this paper, another study described the role of cryptochrome signalling in suppressing COP1-mediated degradation of CO in the dark (Liu et al, 2008). Our data extend the model of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis by providing a molecular explanation for why CO mRNA expression during the night in SDs does not lead to FT transcription and promotion of flowering. The day length-insensitive early-flowering phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and the strong suppression of this phenotype caused by co null alleles demonstrate that degradation of CO under SDs is essential in conferring a photoperiodic flowering response.</text><annotation id="194"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="37670" length="466"/><text>CO activity is proposed to be restricted to LDs by an external coincidence model in which circadian clock control and light signalling combine to trigger CO activity (Searle and Coupland, 2004; Imaizumi and Kay, 2006).

Photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis involves two mechanisms of CO protein degradation: a phyB-dependent mechanism occurs early in the day or in response to red light and a second mechanism involving COP1 occurs late in the day and during the night. (top) In wild-type plants under LDs, CO accumulates in the evening due to an increase in CO mRNA and photoreceptor-mediated repression of COP1. CO can promote FT expression at this time and thereby flowering. During the night, COP1 is active and causes rapid degradation of CO protein by ubiquitination and activity of the proteasome. (second from top) Under SD, CO mRNA is expressed during the night and the protein is degraded through COP1 activity. CO protein does not accumulate and FT mRNA is absent, resulting in late flowering. (second from bottom) In cop1–4 mutants under LDs, CO is not degraded in the dark and accumulates to high levels. CO also accumulates to high levels at the end of the day, consistent with COP1 targeting CO for degradation at that time. However, CO protein still disappears early in the day, suggesting a COP1-independent mechanism of degradation at that time. (bottom) Under SDs in cop1–4 mutants, CO accumulates to a high level during the night and promotes FT expression at higher level than in wild-type plants. Enhanced CO activity at these times is responsible for the early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under SDs. In the morning, CO protein is degraded by a COP1-independent mechanism. The symbols represent CO protein abundance (red circles), COP1 (blue spheres), ubiquitin (small yellow circles on CO) and an unknown red light-activated degradation mechanism that is also active in the morning (dark orange spheres).
