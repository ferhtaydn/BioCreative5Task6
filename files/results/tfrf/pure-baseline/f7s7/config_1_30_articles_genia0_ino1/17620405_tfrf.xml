However, little is known about how it is regulated inside the nucleus. By a two-hybrid approach, we identify a prefoldin-like protein, ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), that is expressed predominantly and interacts specifically with NF-κB inside the nucleus. RNA interference knockdown of UXT leads to impaired NF-κB activity and dramatically attenuates the expression of NF-κB–dependent genes. This interference also sensitizes cells to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, UXT forms a dynamic complex with NF-κB and is recruited to the NF-κB enhanceosome upon stimulation. Interestingly, the UXT protein level correlates with constitutive NF-κB activity in human prostate cancer cell lines. The presence of NF-κB within the nucleus of stimulated or constitutively active cells is considerably diminished with decreased endogenous UXT levels. Our results reveal that UXT is an integral component of the NF-κB enhanceosome and is essential for its nuclear function, which uncovers a new mechanism of NF-κB regulation.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0018</infon><location offset="378" length="194"/><text>By a two-hybrid approach, we identify a prefoldin-like protein, ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), that is expressed predominantly and interacts specifically with NF-κB inside the nucleus.</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0226</infon><location offset="378" length="194"/><text>By a two-hybrid approach, we identify a prefoldin-like protein, ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), that is expressed predominantly and interacts specifically with NF-κB inside the nucleus.</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0413</infon><location offset="378" length="330"/><text>By a two-hybrid approach, we identify a prefoldin-like protein, ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), that is expressed predominantly and interacts specifically with NF-κB inside the nucleus.

Aberrance of its function has been linked to such pathological processes as cancer and abnormal development (for review see Rayet and Gelinas, 1999).

Extensive studies have been performed to address how various stimuli trigger its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). Seminal works from several laboratories have determined a sequence of biochemical events that result in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB proteins (Chen et al., 1996; Hatakeyama et al., 1999; Spencer et al., 1999). Consequently, this releases NF-κB to move into the nucleus and switch on the expression of target genes (Ghosh and Karin, 2002; Li and Verma, 2002). NF-κB belongs to the Rel homology domain (RHD) family of transcription factors that exploit similar strategies to achieve initial activation. Recently, an alternative pathway was identified to regulate another member (p100) of this family (Senftleben et al., 2001).</text><annotation id="12"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="2424" length="223"/><text>Seminal works from several laboratories have determined a sequence of biochemical events that result in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB proteins (Chen et al., 1996; Hatakeyama et al., 1999; Spencer et al., 1999).</text></annotation><annotation id="13"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="2424" length="223"/><text>Seminal works from several laboratories have determined a sequence of biochemical events that result in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB proteins (Chen et al., 1996; Hatakeyama et al., 1999; Spencer et al., 1999).</text></annotation><annotation id="14"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="2939" length="123"/><text>Recently, an alternative pathway was identified to regulate another member (p100) of this family (Senftleben et al., 2001).</text></annotation><annotation id="15"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="2939" length="123"/><text>Recently, an alternative pathway was identified to regulate another member (p100) of this family (Senftleben et al., 2001).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3069</offset><text>Compared with the fruitful know-how about the molecular events of NF-κB activation in cytoplasm, much less is understood concerning its active regulation and functional interaction with other proteins inside the nucleus. Recent progress has shed light on the importance of nuclear events in shaping the strength and duration of the NF-κB transcriptional response, which is achieved partly by posttranslational modification of the NF-κB transcription factor complex or the histones that surround various NF-κB target genes (Chen and Greene, 2004). For example, I κ-B kinase α (IKKα) was demonstrated to accelerate both the turnover of NF-κB and its removal from proinflammatory gene promoters (Lawrence et al., 2005). This kinase could also phosphorylate histone H3 and was critical for NF-κB–responsive gene expression (Yamamoto et al., 2003). Additionally, the acetyltransferase activity of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) was required for the activation of NF-κB–dependent transcriptions. p300/CBP proteins were also found to directly associate with NF-κB, forming a bridge to the basal transcriptional machinery (Gerritsen et al., 1997; Chan and La Thangue, 2001). Although a couple of cofactors were recently shown to reside in the NF-κB enhanceosome, much remains to be done to understand their specific functions and regulatory mechanisms. This indicates that NF-κB assembles a much higher order transcription complex than once expected and that there are additional important layers of regulation for the NF-κB transactivation process.</text><annotation id="16"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="3290" length="622"/><text>Recent progress has shed light on the importance of nuclear events in shaping the strength and duration of the NF-κB transcriptional response, which is achieved partly by posttranslational modification of the NF-κB transcription factor complex or the histones that surround various NF-κB target genes (Chen and Greene, 2004).

It was demonstrated to be widely expressed in human and mouse tissues, and its expression was markedly elevated in some human tumors (Schroer et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2005). Computer modeling predicted that UXT was an α-class prefoldin (PFD) family protein (Gstaiger et al., 2003). Most members of this family are small molecular mass proteins (14–23 kD) and are composed of coiled-coil structures. Yeast and human PFDs 1–6 were previously found to assemble into a hexameric complex that functioned as a new type of molecular chaperone (Vainberg et al., 1998; Siegert et al., 2000).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5338</offset><text>Until now, the functional characterization of UXT was scarce.

The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively. There was no detectable UXT that interacted with cytoplasmic p65 in the presence or absence of TNF-α (Fig. 1 D), which was consistent with the unique subcellular location of UXT. In addition, there was only a marginal amount of endogenous p65 in the nucleus devoid of TNF-α treatment. Consequently, no UXT was coimmunoprecipitated from this nuclear extract even though there existed a large amount of UXT. In contrast, there exhibited a strong interaction between nuclear p65 and UXT upon TNF-α stimulation. Furthermore, we tested whether endogenous UXT and p65 could interact in response to TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 1 E, endogenous UXT was coimmunoprecipitated by p65 antibody from cells treated with TNF-α. In contrast, UXT was barely detected in the immunoprecipitates without TNF-α treatment. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that only after p65 translocation into the nucleus could UXT have access to p65. However, we could not formally rule out the possibility that posttranslational modifications of either protein were prerequisites for this interaction in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that UXT interacts in vivo with p65 upon TNF-α stimulation.</text><annotation id="44"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0412</infon><location offset="9204" length="185"/><text>To address the physiological relevance of this interaction in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-UXT in 293T cells and then stimulated cells with or without TNF-α for the indicated times.</text></annotation><annotation id="45"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0019</infon><location offset="9204" length="185"/><text>To address the physiological relevance of this interaction in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-UXT in 293T cells and then stimulated cells with or without TNF-α for the indicated times.</text></annotation><annotation id="46"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0006</infon><location offset="9390" length="137"/><text>The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively.</text></annotation><annotation id="47"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0413</infon><location offset="9813" length="313"/><text>Consequently, no UXT was coimmunoprecipitated from this nuclear extract even though there existed a large amount of UXT.

To explore the UXT-binding region within p65, we constructed a series of p65 deletion mutants (Fig. 2 A). It was found that the loss of amino acids 1–285 at the N terminus of p65 resulted in its complete inability to interact with UXT (Fig. 2 B, top). In contrast, p65 fragments spanning amino acids 1–286, 1–312, or 1–372 fully retained their binding capability and interacted with UXT as well as the wild type (Fig. 2 B, middle). Because the RHD of p65 consisted of two Ig-like domains (Chen et al., 1998), we made two additional deletion mutants of p65 (amino acids 1–190 and 191–551), each of which contained only one Ig-like domain. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that neither of them was able to interact with UXT (Fig. 2 B, bottom). In addition, we generated several point mutations of UXT and did not observe a considerable change on UXT and p65 interaction. We also had attempted in vain to express truncation mutants of UXT in mammalian cells, which prevented us from further dissecting UXT.

Notably, siRNA 428 was better than siRNA 242 in causing the loss of nuclear p65. In contrast, control siRNA displayed no such effect on the nuclear presence of p65. The transcription factor sp1 as a negative control was expressed constitutively inside the nucleus and remained intact in response to UXT knockdown. The cytoplasmic reservoir of p65 did not seem to be affected by siRNA against UXT (Fig. 5 D). This suggested that UXT positively regulated p65 inside the nucleus, and the loss of it affected the sustained action of p65 in the nucleus, which led to the attenuated EMSA results as observed in Fig. 5 B. Alternatively, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to support this speculation. Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65. Approximately 90% of control cells displayed p65 inside the nucleus upon stimulation, whereas only 35–50% displayed p65 in the case of the UXT knockdown specimen (Fig. 5 E).

Luciferase assays were performed to monitor the effect of UXT knockdown on activations of indicated reporters induced by these chimeric proteins.

The usefulness of UXTr was confirmed so that siRNA 428 no longer had any effects on UXTr but siRNA 242 could still interfere with UXTr expression (Fig. 6 A). The exogenous wild-type UXT or UXTr was transfected together with siRNA 428 and stimulated with TNF-α as indicated, respectively. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were probed with indicated antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the expression of UXTr rescued the loss of nuclear p65 caused by endogenous UXT impairment, whereas the expression of wild-type UXT failed to do so. This rescuing effect was also confirmed with EMSA assays (Fig. 6 C).

Normally, 293T cells would not display apoptotic phenomenon in the presence of TNF-α (&lt;3%). However, loss of NF-κB function would make cells prone to apoptosis. This was confirmed by knocking down UXT upon TNF-α stimulation (∼15%; unpublished data). Cycloheximide (CHX) is a potent protein synthesis inhibitor. However, at the concentration of ≤10 μg/ml, CHX only reduces but does not completely block de novo protein synthesis (Tang et al., 2001). Interestingly, a low concentration of CHX could dramatically augment the apoptotic effects (Yeh et al., 1997; Kelliher et al., 1998). Taking advantage of this cell model, we explored whether UXT was important for cell survival in response to TNF-α treatment. As was shown in Fig. 8, TNF plus 5 μg/ml CHX resulted in ∼10% cell death after 18 h of treatment. More importantly, when siRNA of UXT, which blocked NF-κB activity, was used in combination with TNF and CHX, we detected drastically morphological changes under light microscopy and ∼50% of cells undergoing apoptosis. Alternatively, we used annexin V and TUNEL methods to quantitatively measure the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis. Consistently, a considerable increase of apoptotic cells was observed in samples with reduced UXT (Fig. 8, B and C).

Recently, the regulation of NF-κB activity has been cast in the limelight (Dixit and Mak, 2002; Ghosh and Karin, 2002). A handful of transcriptional cofactors were implicated in this process. For example, p300/CBP played a major role in the acetylation of p65 in vivo (Chen et al., 2002). Conversely, acetylated p65 was subjected to deacetylation by HDAC3 (Chen et al., 2001). Recent work also revealed that SIRT1 physically interacted with p65 and promoted p65 deacetylation (Yeung et al., 2004). In addition, NF-κB was reported to be phosphorylated at multiple sites during activation. For example, IKKα was demonstrated to accelerate both the turnover of NF-κB and its removal from proinflammatory gene promoters (Lawrence et al., 2005). An emerging theme is that there are additional important layers of regulation for nuclear NF-κB.</text><annotation id="232"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="39204" length="305"/><text>For example, p300/CBP played a major role in the acetylation of p65 in vivo (Chen et al., 2002).

In this study, we characterized UXT as a novel and essential cofactor for NF-κB function in its enhanceosome. Several lines of findings support this argument. (1) UXT was shown to interact directly with p65 both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this interaction was dependent on external stimuli. Because UXT was almost exclusively present inside the nucleus, we reasoned that only after NF-κB translocation into the nucleus could this interaction take place, which was also substantiated by the observation that NF-κB was constitutively inside the nucleus in PC-3 cells and regulated by UXT as a result. (2) ChIP and EMSA assays demonstrated that UXT localized inside the NF-κB enhanceosome in vivo and was recruited to it upon stimulation. (3) The knockdown of UXT did not influence the molecular events of NF-κB activation outside the nucleus. Instead, it decreased the amount of nuclear p65 and severely impaired NF-κB activation. This decrease could be rescued by a siRNA-resistant exogenous UXT. (4) Overexpression of UXT caused marginal synergic inductions of both A20 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. We reasoned that there was a sufficient amount of endogenous UXT within the nucleus in 293T cells so that it would be difficult to demonstrate the synergic effect more dramatically. Convincingly, RNAi of UXT resulted in apparent attenuations of NF-κB–responsive reporter expression by various stimuli and, ultimately, the inducible expression of genes tightly regulated by NF-κB. (5) The reduction of endogenous UXT tamed cells prone to apoptosis that was induced by TNF-α, which is a known index for the impairment of NF-κB function. (6) PC-3 cells displayed constitutive NF-κB activity inside the nucleus. This was nicely correlated with the elevated presence of both NF-κB and UXT within the nucleus, which was also consistently substantiated by the loss of NF-κB and its activity when endogenous UXT was diminished in PC-3 cells. Thus, UXT might function to extend the duration of NF-κB or its enhanceosome inside the nucleus.</text><annotation id="237"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0413</infon><location offset="39856" length="243"/><text>Regulating the duration of the nuclear presence of p65 is another potential mechanism to modulate the NF-κB transcriptional response.

UXT was recently predicted as a new member of the α-class PFD family protein. Yeast and human PFDs 1–6 assembled into a hexameric complex, which functioned as a molecular chaperone in protein folding. Our preliminary data also suggested that UXT forms oligomers in vivo (unpublished data). Some members of the PFD family protein were implicated to participate in transcriptional regulation, such as PFDN5 (MM1) in c-myc transcription (Satou et al., 2001) and URI in the rapamycin-sensitive transcription response (Gstaiger et al., 2003). However, the specific mechanisms of their action remain unknown. We have generated several point mutations of UXT (C75A, L32P, L50P, L59P, and L32P/L50P/L59P) and did not reveal any substantial correlation between UXT and p65 interaction. Our speculation is that a three-dimensional juxtaposed motif may be involved in this interaction.

An NF-κB coactivator, Pin1, was found to bind p65 and prevent SOCS-1–mediated ubiquitination (Ryo et al., 2003). We have tried to address whether the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is critical for p65 stability in the context of UXT, but no conclusion can be made as of now. The problem lies in the fact that most proteins are instantly degraded after ubiquitination, which is also the case for p65. To prevent this obstacle, proteasome inhibitors were used to stabilize ubiquitinated proteins. Unfortunately, a critical step during NF-κB activation involved proteasome function (i.e., IκBα degradation), which makes it unpractical to probe endogenous p65 degradation inside the nucleus. The few papers that reported nuclear p65 ubiquitination often used the overexpression of p65 to answer this question, which was a controversial approach. After this method, we did observe traces of p65 ubiquitination when UXT was knocked down (unpublished data), which was comparable with published reports (Ryo et al., 2003). However, we believe it is too early to correlate the loss of UXT with p65 ubiquitination. Substantially, we found that LMB, a specific inhibitor of nuclear export, increased the nuclear accumulation of p65 even though the endogenous UXT was knocked down. More likely, UXT influenced p65 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.</text><annotation id="253"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="43191" length="458"/><text>Recently, studies suggested that the ubiquitin–proteasomal degradation pathway was also involved in stringent control of the promoter-bound p65 (Ryo et al., 2003; Saccani et al., 2004).

Nuclear chaperones usually mediate nucleosome assembly and remodeling (Philpott et al., 2000; Loyola and Almouzni, 2004). Furthermore, they were implicated to directly regulate transcription factors. For example, a nuclear chaperone termed FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) could facilitate transcript elongation through nucleosomes (Orphanides et al., 1998). Another human nuclear chaperone (bZIP-enhancing factor) promoted the transcriptional activity of bZIP (basic region–leucine zipper DNA-binding domain) proteins (Virbasius et al., 1999). JDP2 was recently demonstrated to be a chaperone for AP1 (Jin et al., 2006). In addition, nuclear chaperones can also negatively regulate transcription. For example, nuclear chaperones p23 and Hsp90 bound to glucocorticoid-induced regulatory complexes and consequently disassembled these complexes (Freeman and Yamamoto, 2002). In conclusion, nuclear chaperones have regulatory functions targeted to their specific client proteins other than the classic functions involved in protein synthesis and maturation. More work needs to be done before the function and mechanism of UXT action are fully understood.</text><annotation id="258"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0413</infon><location offset="44716" length="138"/><text>Given the findings from this study, we favor the notion that UXT is a nuclear chaperone that promotes formation of the NF-κB enhanceosome.</text></annotation><annotation id="259"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="44855" length="121"/><text>Nuclear chaperones usually mediate nucleosome assembly and remodeling (Philpott et al., 2000; Loyola and Almouzni, 2004).</text></annotation><annotation id="260"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="44855" length="121"/><text>Nuclear chaperones usually mediate nucleosome assembly and remodeling (Philpott et al., 2000; Loyola and Almouzni, 2004).</text></annotation><annotation id="261"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="45055" length="431"/><text>For example, a nuclear chaperone termed FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) could facilitate transcript elongation through nucleosomes (Orphanides et al., 1998).
