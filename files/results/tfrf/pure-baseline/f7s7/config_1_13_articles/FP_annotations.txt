Using accurate genome-wide expression profiles of breast cancers, we found maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) to be significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cells. To assess whether MELK has a role in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous MELK in breast cancer cell lines using mammalian vector-based RNA interference. Furthermore, we identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a possible substrate for MELK by pull-down assay with recombinant wild-type and kinase-dead MELK.

Using accurate genome-wide expression profiles of breast cancers, we found maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) to be significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cells. To assess whether MELK has a role in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous MELK in breast cancer cell lines using mammalian vector-based RNA interference.

0426
Finally, we performed TUNEL assays and FACS analysis, measuring proportions of apoptotic cells, to investigate whether MELK is involved in the apoptosis cascade through the Bcl-GL-related pathway.
0004
Northern blot analyses on multiple human tissues and cancer cell lines demonstrated that MELK was overexpressed at a significantly high level in a great majority of breast cancers and cell lines, but was not expressed in normal vital organs (heart, liver, lung and kidney).

0411
Suppression of MELK expression by small interfering RNA significantly inhibited growth of human breast cancer cells.
0423
Our findings suggest that the kinase activity of MELK is likely to affect mammary carcinogenesis through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL. The kinase activity of MELK could be a promising molecular target for development of therapy for patients with breast cancers.
0423
After comparing the expression profiles of these breast cancers with those of various normal human tissues [9], we focused on a gene termed maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) that was significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cases examined.
0423
In this study, we report evidence indicating that MELK functions as a cancer-specific protein kinase, and that down-regulation of MELK results in growth suppression of breast cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrate that MELK physically interacts and phosphorylates a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Our findings suggest that the kinase activity of MELK is likely to affect mammary carcinogenesis through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL. We propose that MELK kinase activity could be a promising molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer.

To characterize the variants specifically transcribed in breast cancer cells, we screened a cDNA library of breast cancer cells. Subsequent cDNA sequencing analysis identified three different transcriptional variants, designated V1 (2,501 bp; NM_014791), V2 (2,368 bp; AB183427) and V3 (2,251 bp; AB183428).
0423
Furthermore, although all of the three variant proteins possess the KA1 domain in their carboxyl terminus, the V2 and V3 proteins lack the amino-terminal portion, which corresponds to the first 48 amino acids of the V1 protein and is considered to be the catalytic kinase domain (Figure 1g).

0411
Although we can not rule out the possibility that the V2 and V3 variants have some functional role in carcinogenesis, for example, dominant-negative functions, in this study we focus on the kinase activity of the V1 transcript due to its predominant expression in cancer cells.
0004

To investigate the biological functions of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for substrates of MELK in cancer cells by in vitro protein pull-down assays using wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK) recombinant proteins. Comparison of silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels containing the pulled-down proteins identified an approximately 30 kDa protein in the lane corresponding to proteins pulled-down with WT-MELK but not in that corresponding to proteins pulled-down with D150A-MELK (Figure 3a).
0054
We first examined the expression patterns of these Bcl-G isoforms at the transcriptional level in breast cancer cell lines by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and found that Bcl-GS and Bcl-GL were expressed in all breast cancer cells examined, whereas the Bcl-Gm transcript was not detected at all (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined expression of endogenous Bcl-GL in breast cancer cell lines at the protein level by western blot analysis using an anti-Bcl-GL antibody and detected an approximately 30 kDa endogenous Bcl-GL, corresponding to the size identified by protein pull-down experiment, in all the breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure 3b).

0423
Therefore, we focused on Bcl-GL as a candidate interacting protein for MELK.
0107
To validate an interaction between WT-MELK and Bcl-GL, we constructed plasmids designed to express HA-tagged WT-MELK (HA-WT-MELK) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL).

0006
These plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells and the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody.

0019
To further determine which segment of Bcl-GL can interact with WT-MELK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HA-WT-MELK and partial Bcl-GL proteins tagged with Flag (Figure 3e). After co-transfection of plasmid clones into HeLa cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, and then immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody.

0424
We found that the N-1 construct (amino acids 12 to 327) as well as a full-length Bcl-GL (FL) bound to WT-MELK, whereas N-2 (amino acids 72 to 324), N-3 (amino acids 121 to 327) or N-4 (amino acids 171 to 327) did not (Figure 3f).

0423
Concordantly, all of the partial products that contained the amino-terminal portion of Bcl-GL – C-1 (amino acids 1 to 305), C-2 (amino acids 1 to 295), and C-3 (amino acids 1 to 215) bound to WT-MELK (Figure 3f).
0423
To examine whether the Bcl-GL protein is a substrate of MELK kinase activity, we performed an immune complex kinase assay.

0007
We first confirmed the exogenous expression of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL) by western blot analysis (Figure 3f). As shown in Figure 4a, WT-MELK could phosphorylate Bcl-GL, but D150A-MELK could not (single arrowhead).

We first confirmed the exogenous expression of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (Flag-Bcl-GL) by western blot analysis (Figure 3f).

0423
In addition, autophosphorylation of an approximately 75 kDa protein of MELK was observed (Figure 4a; double arrowheads). Furthermore, we also confirmed that WT-MELK could phosphorylate GST-Bcl-GL but D150A-MELK could not (Figure 4b), indicating MELK can directly phosphorylate Bcl-GL. These findings suggest that Bcl-GL is a potential substrate for MELK.

First, we confirmed the amount of immunoprecipitated protein corresponding to partial Bcl-GL (N-1, N-2, N-3 and N-4) as well as to full-length Bcl-GL (FL) by western blot analysis (Figure 3f), and then examined the extent of their phosphorylation (Figure 4c). The MELK recombinant protein phosphorylated N-1 as well as full-length Bcl-GL, whereas it could not phosphorylate N-2, N-3 or N-4 proteins, corresponding with their inability to interact.

0423
Because MELK can physically interact with and phosphorylate Bcl-GL (Figures 3d and 4a), we hypothesized that it might be involved in the apoptosis cascade through the Bcl-GL-related pathway. To investigate this hypothesis, we transiently co-transfected two plasmid clones designed to express HA-tagged MELK (WT or D150A) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL into COS7 cells, and then performed a TUNEL assay and FACS analysis to measure the proportions of apoptotic cells (see Material and methods).

0426
As indicated in Figure 5b,c, the overexpression of full-length Bcl-GL (HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-GL) significantly increased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the cells transfected with the mock plasmids (HA-Mock+Flag-Mock), indicating that Bcl-GL induces apoptosis, as described previously [14].

In contrast, the co-overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-GL (HA-WT-MELK+Flag-Bcl-GL) reduced the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with over-expression of Bcl-GL alone (HA-Mock+Flag-Bcl-GL) (P = 0.0001, unpaired t-test).

0007
Similarly to the TUNEL analysis, the overexpression of WT-MELK with Bcl-GL reduced the proportion of sub-G1 cells (P = 0.03, unpaired t-test), while D150A-MELK increased the sub-G1 population.

0423
Our results imply that the kinase activity of MELK may play a critical role in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL.

Using genome-wide expression profiles of breast cancers and normal human tissues [8,9], we identified MELK, one of the transcripts of which was specifically up-regulated in the great majority of clinical breast cancer samples, but expressed in none of 29 normal human tissues examined except testis, thymus and small intestine.

0411
We demonstrated by means of siRNA that knockdown of endogenous MELK expression results in growth suppression of breast cancer cells (Figure 2).
0423
MELK was previously identified as a new member of the snf1/AMPK serine-threonine kinase family that is involved in mammalian embryonic development [15-18].

0411
To investigate the expression pattern of these proteins in breast cancer cells, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and observed no significant correlation of gene expression between MELK and these interacting molecules in breast cancer cells (data not shown). Thus, to investigate the biological significance of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for a possible substrate(s) of MELK by means of in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK).

0423
We identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a potential substrate for MELK. In addition to physical interaction between these two proteins, in vitro immune complex kinase and in vitro binding assays showed that Bcl-GL was directly bound to MELK and specifically phosphorylated by it in vitro (Figures 3d and 4a,b).

0426
As reported previously [14], we demonstrated by TUNEL assay and FACS analysis that introduction of full-length Bcl-GL into COS7 cells induced apoptosis.

0007
However, under the same conditions, addition of exogenous WT-MELK suppressed induction of apoptosis by Bcl-GL, but addition of D150A-MELK did not (Figure 5b–d).

0423
Thus, we speculate that MELK might promote cell growth by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL through its phosphorylation.
0423
Our findings clearly suggest that MELK is overexpressed in both breast cancer specimens and cancer cell lines, and that its kinase activity possibly plays a significant role in breast cancer cell growth.

0423
We found that down-regulation of MELK by treatment with siRNA significantly suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer, indicating its crucial role in the proliferation and tumorgenesis of breast cancer. In particular, we demonstrate a new biological function for MELK in breast carcinogenesis, the inhibition of apoptosis though its interaction with and phosphorylation of Bcl-GL, a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family. Our data should contribute to a better understanding of breast carcinogenesis, and they suggest that MELK is a promising molecular target for breast cancer treatment.

Given the abundant expression of both Cdk5 and Trk receptors in the nervous system, and their mutual involvement in the regulation of neuronal architecture and synaptic functions, it is of interest to investigate if Cdk5 may also modulate Trk signaling. In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a Cdk5 substrate. Cdk5 phosphorylates TrkB at Ser478 at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of TrkB. Interestingly, attenuation of Cdk5 activity or overexpression of a TrkB mutant lacking the Cdk5 phosphorylation site essentially abolishes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–triggered dendritic growth in primary hippocampal neurons.

For example, stimulation of hippocampal neurons with one neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increases the number of dendrites directly extending from the cell body. Here, we report that BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth requires phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor, TrkB, by a kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5).

Here, we report that BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth requires phosphorylation of the BDNF receptor, TrkB, by a kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Inhibiting phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 essentially abolishes the induction of dendrites by BDNF. Our observations reveal that Cdk5 serves as a regulator of neurotrophin function. Since Cdk5 and neurotrophins both play essential roles in neuronal development, our findings suggest that the interplay between Cdk5 and TrkB may also be implicated in the regulation of other biological processes during development.

0006
NGF interacts selectively with TrkA, while BDNF and NT-4/5 bind preferentially to TrkB. NT-3, on the other hand, associates with TrkC with high affinity, although it also binds TrkA and TrkB with low affinity.
0006
Furthermore, swollen soma and nuclear margination is evident in Cdk5-deficient neurons, implicating Cdk5 as an essential regulator of neuronal survival [7]. Interestingly, truncation of the Cdk5 activator p35 into p25 has also been associated with prolonged Cdk5 activation in a number of neurodegenerative diseases [9], thus revealing that precise regulation of Cdk5 activity is essential for maintenance of neuronal survival [10]. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies are pointing to an essential role of Cdk5 at the synapse, where it is not only involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses, but is also indispensable for the regulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity [5].
0006
In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a substrate of Cdk5.

0419
More importantly, we found that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB is essential for BDNF-induced dendritic growth through the modulation of Cdc42 activity.
0081
Literature search revealed that TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC all contain serine- or threonine-directed proline residues at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptors, but only TrkB and TrkC contain Cdk5 consensus sites S/TPXK/H/R (Figure 1A).

0019
TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC was overexpressed together with Cdk5 or p35 in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed with Cdk5, p35, or pan-Trk antibody. Interestingly, all three Trk receptors were observed to associate with Cdk5 (Figure 1B) and p35 (Figure 1C), while no association was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG control.

0107
Since both TrkB and its ligand BDNF are abundantly expressed in the brain throughout development, we next proceeded to verify the interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 in postnatal brains.

0107
Since both p35 and Cdk5 are present in brain lysates and likely exist as a complex, the observed interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 did not provide specific information on whether TrkB associated specifically with Cdk5 or p35. To delineate between these two possibilities, the interaction between TrkB, p35, and Cdk5 was examined in p35+/+ and p35−/− brain lysates (Figure 1F).
0081
This is in agreement with the lack of Cdk5 consensus sites in TrkA, and points to the possibility that Cdk5 may phosphorylate TrkB and TrkC at the Cdk5 consensus sites at the juxtamembrane region (Figure 1A).

0423
In vitro kinase assay verified that Cdk5/p35 phosphorylated TrkB at the juxtamembrane region (Figure 2B).

0006
It has previously been proposed that p25 and p35 may confer different substrate specificities. Results from our in vitro kinase assay suggested that Cdk5 phosphorylated TrkB regardless of whether it was activated by p25 or p35, although further studies will be required to delineate the relative contributions of p25 and p35 to endogenous phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5.

0006
We were next interested in identifying the Cdk5 phosphorylation site(s) on TrkB. Three TrkB-juxtamembrane region mutants were generated: TrkB M1, where Ser478 was mutated to alanine; TrkB M2, where Thr489 was mutated to alanine; and TrkB DM, where both Ser478 and Thr489 were mutated to alanine. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the TrkB-juxtamembrane region was almost completely abolished when Cdk5/p25 was incubated with TrkB M1 or TrkB DM (Figure 2C), thus revealing that Ser478 was required for Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of the TrkB-juxtamembrane region. We further verified the importance of this site for Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB by generating a phospho-specific TrkB antibody against Ser478. Preincubation of the antibody with blocking peptide prevented detection of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB, indicating that the antibody was sufficiently specific (Figure 2D). Full-length TrkB mutants lacking the potential Cdk5 phosphorylation sites were overexpressed with or without Cdk5/p35 in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB was not observed in the absence of Cdk5/p35, indicating that Cdk5 was essential for the phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in HEK293T cells. More importantly, when TrkB mutants lacking Ser478 were expressed (TrkB M1 and TrkB DM), phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 was essentially abolished (Figure 2E). Taken together, our observations indicate that Cdk5 phosphorylated TrkB at Ser478 at the juxtamembrane region of TrkB.

0006
To further examine if Cdk5 is essential for phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in vivo, we examined the effect of inhibiting Cdk5 activity on phospho-Ser478 (p-Ser478) TrkB levels in cortical neurons. We found that at basal level, TrkB was weakly phosphorylated at Ser478. Interestingly, stimulation with BDNF led to a marked increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels, indicating that phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 was at least in part ligand dependent. Remarkably, treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor roscovitine (Ros) almost abrogated the BDNF-triggered increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels (Figure 3A), suggesting that Cdk5 was involved in the BDNF-stimulated component of TrkB Ser478 phosphorylation. To further establish the involvement of Cdk5 in Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB in vivo, the levels of p-Ser478 TrkB in cdk5+/+ and cdk5−/− brain lysates were examined. Importantly, we found that Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB was basically undetectable in Cdk5−/− brain lysates (Figure 3B). Similarly, cortical neurons prepared from Cdk5−/− brains exhibited undetectable levels of p-Ser478 TrkB. In addition, BDNF stimulation failed to trigger an increase in p-Ser478 TrkB levels (Figure 3C). These observations strongly suggest that Cdk5 is essential for phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in vivo, and that BDNF-stimulated increase in Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB requires Cdk5 activity.
0006
Since BDNF stimulation was observed to increase Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB, and Cdk5 was required for phosphorylating TrkB at Ser478, we were interested to examine if BDNF stimulation affects Cdk5 activity. BDNF has previously been observed to increase Cdk5 activity after 3 d of BDNF stimulation in cortical neurons [11]. In agreement with this observation, we found that BDNF treatment led to an increase in Cdk5 activity within 15 min of BDNF stimulation (Figure 4A). More importantly, addition of Trk inhibitor K252a essentially abolished BDNF-triggered increase in Cdk5 activity, indicating that the increase in Cdk5 activity was dependent on TrkB activation (Figure 4B). It has previously been demonstrated that Cdk5 activity is enhanced by phosphorylation at Tyr15 [12]. Given the activation of tyrosine kinase activity of TrkB upon ligand stimulation, we were interested to investigate if BDNF treatment leads to phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15, thereby enhancing its activity. We found that BDNF stimulation enhanced association between Cdk5 and TrkB in cortical neurons (Figure 4C). More importantly, in vitro kinase assay using purified TrkB and Cdk5 revealed that TrkB phosphorylated Cdk5 at Tyr15 (Figure 4D and 4E). TrkB-mediated phosphorylation of Cdk5 was abolished with the addition of Trk inhibitor K252a, further verifying that Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdk5 was TrkB dependent (Figure 4E). These observations collectively indicate that upon BDNF stimulation, Cdk5 was recruited to TrkB and phosphorylated by TrkB at Tyr15, thus leading to enhanced Cdk5 activity to promote phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478.

0423
More importantly, in vitro kinase assay using purified TrkB and Cdk5 revealed that TrkB phosphorylated Cdk5 at Tyr15 (Figure 4D and 4E).
0006
Given the neural-specific nature of Cdk5, its abundant expression throughout development, and its essential role in the phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478, we were interested in examining the biological significance of this phosphorylation on the downstream functions of BDNF/TrkB signaling. As a first step, we examined if Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB affects TrkB activation and downstream signaling cascades. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of Cdk5 activity by Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros only marginally affected tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB and initiation of downstream signaling pathways including phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt, and CREB (data not shown). Indeed, BDNF-stimulated increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation was weakly affected in cdk5−/− cortical neurons (Figure 3C). Furthermore, activation of Akt and Erk1/2 following BDNF stimulation was also comparable in cdk5+/+ and cdk5−/− cortical neurons (data not shown).
0419
In accordance with earlier observations, BDNF treatment led to a marked increase in the number of primary dendrites in hippocampal neurons (Figure 5A), although the length and branching of dendrites were not affected (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros almost completely abolished the BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth, without affecting the basal number of dendrites (Figure 5A). Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative (DN) Cdk5 (Figure 5B) and transfection with Cdk5 short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Figure 5C) both abrogated BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites.
0419
To examine if phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 affects dendritic growth through modulating BDNF-triggered activation of Cdc42, we first examined if the BDNF-induced increase in Cdc42 activity was affected by treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros. In agreement with earlier findings, BDNF treatment resulted in an increase in Cdc42 activity. Interestingly, treatment with Ros significantly reduced BDNF-induced Cdc42 activity in cortical neurons (Figure 6B), suggesting that Cdk5 activity was involved in BDNF-triggered activation of Cdc42. To investigate if the reduction in Cdc42 activity contributes to the abrogation of BDNF-induced dendritic growth following attenuation of Cdk5 activity, the effect of overexpressing constitutively active (CA) Cdc42 with TrkB M1 on BDNF-induced dendritic growth was examined. Remarkably, overexpression of CA Cdc42 reversed the abrogation of BDNF-induced dendritic growth by TrkB M1 (Figure 6C). More importantly, while overexpression of CA Cdc42 had negligible effect on BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites in Cdk5+/+ neurons, overexpression of CA Cdc42 similarly rescued the lack of dendritic growth in cdk5−/− neurons following BDNF stimulation (Figure 6D). These observations strongly suggest that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 was essential for the BDNF-triggered increase in primary dendrites through modulating BDNF-induced Cdc42 activity.

0006
In the current study, we report the identification of TrkB as a novel Cdk5 substrate by providing evidence that Cdk5 phosphorylates TrkB at Ser478, located at the intracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The near absence of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB in cdk5−/− brain underscores the importance of Cdk5 in this phosphorylation in vivo. More importantly, we found that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB is required for BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites.

0419
Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cdk5 activity is involved in BDNF-induced increase in Cdc42 activity, which underlies BDNF-induced dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons.

0006
Overexpression of CA Cdc42 restored BDNF-stimulated increase in primary dendrites in cdk5−/− neurons, lending further support that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 is essential for BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation and increase in primary dendrites. Our findings therefore reveal an unanticipated role of Cdk5 in mediating downstream functions of Trk signaling.
0419
For example, a recent study reported that synaptic maturation involves BDNF-stimulated increase in Cdc42 activity [16]. In addition, activation of Cdc42 is involved in the regulation of retinal growth cone filopodia by BDNF [17].

0419
Our observation that BDNF-stimulated increase in Cdc42 activity contributes to the increase in primary dendrites corroborates these studies. It is interesting to note that overexpression of WT and DN Rac1 and RhoA also inhibited BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites. While it is rather intriguing to observe similar actions by the WT and DN forms of these two Rho GTPases, our observation nonetheless suggests that Rac1 and RhoA may also play a role in BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Further studies will be required to delineate their involvements in BDNF-dependent regulation of dendritic development.
0419
Although different Rho GTPases have been identified as essential downstream mediators of neurotrophin functions, much less is known about the mechanisms by which neurotrophin treatment results in Rho GTPase activation, and how this process is regulated. The activity of Rho GTPases is controlled by a number of factors.

0419
The activated Rho GTPases then translocate to the plasma membrane, where they activate other downstream effectors such as PAK1 to modulate actin dynamics [19]. Indeed, neurotrophins have recently been observed to induce Rho GTPase activity through recruitment of a number of GEFs.

0419
Two recent studies reveal that neurotrophin stimulation in Schwann cells also leads to Rho GTPase activation through activation of GEFs.
0419
On the other hand, recent studies accentuate the importance of membrane recruitment of Rho GTPase to lipid rafts for the function of these Rho GTPases.

0419
Finally, BDNF has also been observed to increase Cdc42 activity in cerebellar granule neurons through enhancing calcium influx following the activation of PLCγ and PI3K pathways, a series of events that are essential for BDNF-mediated growth cone turning [27]. While a number of mechanisms have been postulated to underlie neurotrophin-mediated activation of Rho GTPases, it appears that the mechanisms implicated may vary with different downstream functions of Trk activation and the GEF involved.
0006
In the current study, we demonstrated that Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 is essential for the Cdc42-dependent increase in primary dendrites triggered by BDNF, thus adding a new regulatory component to the mechanisms involved in Rho GTPase activation by neurotrophin.

0006
First of all, while inhibition of Cdk5-mediated TrkB phosphorylation at Ser478 essentially abolished BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites, it was surprising to observe that Cdk5 activity had a negligible effect on TrkB activation and initiation of downstream signaling pathways. This suggests that Cdk5 activity probably did not affect BDNF-dependent activation of Cdc42 and the induction of primary dendrites through modulating activation of downstream signaling.

Since we examined changes in TrkB downstream signaling cascades only in total lysates, it remains possible that Cdk5 activity may specifically affect TrkB signaling only at certain subcellular/plasma membrane compartments.

Secondly, overexpression of CA Cdc42 restored BDNF-induced dendritic growth in cdk5−/− neurons and in neurons overexpressing TrkB M1 (Figure 6), suggesting that maintenance of Cdc42 activation was sufficient to overcome the lack of BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth when Cdk5-mediated TrkB phosphorylation was absent. It thus appears that Cdk5 may impair BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation by affecting activation of the Rho GTPase. On the other hand, it should also be noted that overexpression of both the DN and CA forms of Cdc42 had a negligible effect on the basal number of primary dendrites in both cdk5+/+ and cdk5−/− neurons (Figure 6). Our observation is in agreement with an earlier study demonstrating that overexpression of DN or CA Cdc42 had no effect on the number of primary dendrites in chick spinal neurons [30]. In addition, it is consistent with the observation that modulation of Cdk5 activity or overexpression of TrkB M1 affected only BDNF-induced dendritic growth, without affecting the basal number of dendrites. Nonetheless, the inability of CA Cdc42 to mimic BDNF in the induction of primary dendrites suggests that activation of Cdc42 per se was insufficient to trigger dendritic growth in the absence of BDNF, and that additional, BDNF-dependent event(s) are required for the induction of dendritic growth by BDNF. Although the precise pathways implicated remain to be identified, it is tempting, in light of the emerging importance of lipid rafts in the activation of Rho GTPase, to speculate that BDNF may be required to stimulate translocation of activated Cdc42 to lipid rafts. In support of this hypothesis, it was observed that activation of Rac1 depends on the translocation of the activated Rho GTPase to lipid rafts [25,26].

0419
These observations collectively suggest that the inability of CA Cdc42 to increase dendritic growth in the absence of BDNF treatment may be related to the lack of CA Cdc42 translocation to lipid rafts, which may potentially be induced by BDNF treatment. A thorough investigation of the importance of lipid rafts in Cdc42 activation and primary dendrite induction by BDNF will shed light on the mechanisms by which BDNF-triggered dendritic growth is regulated.
0006
Given the near absence of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB in cdk5−/− brain, we believe that Cdk5 functions as the predominant kinase for this phosphorylation in vivo. Nonetheless, it was interesting to note that prior to BDNF stimulation, a basal level of Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB was detected in cortical neurons that was not inhibited by pretreatment with the Cdk5 inhibitor Ros. This may suggest that other serine kinases are present to phosphorylate TrkB at Ser478 in the absence of BDNF stimulation. Nonetheless, given the marked inhibition of BDNF-stimulated increase in TrkB phosphorylation by Ros, we believe that Cdk5 is essential for the BDNF-dependent component of TrkB phosphorylation at Ser478.
0006
Given the abundant expression of Cdk5 and TrkB in neurons throughout development, and their respective concentration at the synapse, it would be interesting to examine if Cdk5 activity is also involved in other downstream functions of TrkB signaling, such as the regulation of neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Preliminary findings from our laboratory reveal that Cdk5 activity is also required for BDNF-stimulated neuronal survival in cortical neurons (unpublished data).

0006
In addition, since Cdk5 was observed to associate with TrkA without phosphorylating the receptor, further delineation of the consequences of this interaction would be essential for thoroughly understanding the crosstalk between Trk receptors and Cdk5. A preliminary study revealed that, similar to TrkB, TrkA phosphorylates Cdk5 at Tyr15 (unpublished data). The differential interaction of TrkA and TrkB with Cdk5, together with the differential localization of TrkA and TrkB in different neuronal populations, may provide a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 can regulate the signaling of different neuronal populations. In conclusion, our findings have provided evidence for a regulatory role of Cdk5 in Trk-induced dendritic growth, and lend support for an emerging role of Cdk5 as a regulator of RTK signaling.

(A) BDNF stimulation resulted in an increase in p-Ser478 TrkB (p-Ser TrkB) levels in cortical neurons. Treatment with Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros (25 μM) inhibited the BDNF-induced increase in p-Ser478 TrkB, although Ros treatment also resulted in a slight increase in basal p-Ser478 TrkB.
0006
(B) cdk5+/+ and cdk5−/− brain lysates were immunoblotted against TrkB, phospho-TrkB at Ser478, and β-actin as loading control. p-Ser478 TrkB was almost completely absent in cdk5−/− brain, indicating the importance of Cdk5 in the phosphorylation of TrkB at Ser478 in vivo.
0006
(C) Cortical neurons isolated from cdk5+/+ and cdk5−/− brain were treated with BDNF for different periods. Interestingly, while BDNF enhanced TrkB Ser478 phosphorylation in cdk5+/+ cortical neurons, TrkB Ser478 phosphorylation was not detected in cdk5−/− neurons, nor did BDNF stimulation enhance Ser478 phosphorylation, indicating that BDNF-stimulated increase in TrkB Ser478 phosphorylation requires Cdk5 activity.

(A) Hippocampal neurons were transfected with the WT or DN form of Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were exposed to BDNF for 3 d. Overexpression of DN Cdc42 markedly reduced BDNF-induced increase in primary dendrites compared to overexpression of WT Cdc42, indicating that Cdc42 may contribute to the BDNF-dependent induction of dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons.
0419
(B) Cortical neurons were pretreated with Cdk5 selective inhibitor Ros or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min prior to treatment with BDNF for different time intervals. Ros pretreatment markedly reduced BDNF-induced increase in Cdc42 activity following 15 and 30 min of BDNF treatment, indicating that Cdk5 activity was involved in BDNF-triggered Cdc42 activation. Quantification of the changes in Cdc42 activity following BDNF stimulation with or without Ros pretreatment was normalized to the value obtained for the DMSO-treated group at time 0 and is shown in the histogram.

Mutation of the valine to alanine, or phenylalanine to alanine, within the (K/R)/(V/I)/XF PP1 binding domain, has been shown to affect the binding of PP1 with other interacting proteins [22]. When BR-4 containing a V-A or F-A alteration was analyzed for its ability to interact with PP1, a significant decrease was observed in the amount of PP1 that interacted with the BR-4 V-A or F-A GST fusion protein compared to the wild type BR-4 fragment (Figure 1C), indicating that this sequence is required to mediate the interaction between BRCA1 and PP1.

APPL1 is an effector of the small GTPase Rab5. Together, they mediate a signal transduction pathway initiated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors.

This BAR–PH interaction is likely conserved in the class of BAR-PH containing proteins. Biochemical analyses indicate two independent Rab-binding sites located at the opposite ends of the dimer, where the PH domain directly interacts with Rab5 and Rab21. Besides structurally supporting the PH domain, the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding through a small surface region in the vicinity of the PH domain. In stark contrast to the helix-dominated, Rab-binding domains previously reported, APPL1 PH domain employs β-strands to interact with Rab5.

Endocytosis induced by ligand−receptor interaction has been directly linked to signal transduction mediated by Rab5 and its effector APPL1 (Adaptor protein containing PH domain PTB domain and Leucine zipper motif; Miaczynska et al, 2004; Mao et al, 2006). The small GTPase Rab5 is a generally acknowledged prominent regulator of vesicle trafficking enroute from the plasma membrane to early endosomes (Li, 1996), whereas APPL1 (also called DIP13α) is identified with signaling pathways of adiponectin, insulin, EGF, follicle stimulating hormone receptor, neurotrophin receptor (TrkA), oxidative stress, and DCC-mediated apoptosis (Liu et al, 2002; Miaczynska et al, 2004; Lin et al, 2006; Mao et al, 2006; Varsano et al, 2006; Nechamen et al, 2007). Within this milieu, APPL1 specifically binds to the GTP-bound, active form of Rab5. In response to extracellular stimuli, Rab5 hydrolyzes its bound GTP, releasing APPL1 from an endocytic structure, and allowing APPL1 to further interact with components of nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complexes. The interaction with Rab5 is essential for APPL1 localization to the endosomes and is indispensable for the functional cycle of APPL1 (Miaczynska et al, 2004).

0419
The PH domain is approximately 100-residue long, and has been identified in over 100 different eukaryotic proteins such as kinases, isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC), GTPases, and their regulators; most of which participate in cell signaling and cytoskeletal regulation (Rebecchi and Scarlata, 1998). Despite their minimal sequence homology, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of PH domains are remarkably conserved.

0096
For instance, the PH domain of APPL1 alone is insufficient for binding to the membrane (Miaczynska et al, 2004). The PH domain immediately follows the C-terminus of the BAR domain; such a BAR-PH motif is essential for Rab5 binding. The same motif has also been found in a homolog Rab5 effector APPL2, centaurin-β family members, GRAF2, and oligophrenin (Habermann, 2004), but the 3D structure organization of BAR-PH motif and its functional implication remained elusive until now.

In order to address the functional roles of the BAR-PH motif in APPL1 and related proteins, we have carried out structure-function studies on human APPL1 and determined the crystal structures of the Rab5-binding region of APPL1 as well as the BAR domain alone.

The results show that two BAR-PH molecules form an integrated, symmetric homodimer, and the PH domain has extensive intermolecular interactions with the BAR domain.

The BAR dimer of APPL1 has a stronger curvature than other reported BAR structures. Further mutagenesis analyses allowed us to identify the binding sites on both APPL1 and Rab5. In sharp contrast to the presumed conflict between concurrent membrane association and GTPase binding by the BAR dimer (Habermann, 2004), the novel binding mode of the BAR-PH dimer should permit simultaneous interactions with both.

In addition, the APPL1 α1 and α2 helices lack extensive patches of positively charged aa residues on the concave surface (Figure 2); such patches are thought to be essential for some BAR containing proteins to induce in vitro tubule formation (Carlton et al, 2004).
0104
We implemented a computing algorithm to calculate the curvature radius (rC) and found that the APPL1 BAR dimer has an rC about 55 Å (Supplementary data; Supplementary Figure 2), significantly smaller than the rC values of other BAR dimers (Peter et al, 2004).
0419
The APPL1 PH domain encompasses residues Asn276−Leu379 and has a typical PH folding (Supplementary Figure 3). The core structure of PH domain consists of a pair of nearly orthogonal β-sheets of four and three antiparallel β-strands (β1–β2–β3–β4 and β5–β6–β7; Supplementary Figure 1). The C-terminal α-helix, αC, packs against both β-sheets and contributes to the core of the domain. In the PH domain, connecting loops are named after the preceding β-strands (e.g., the loop between β1 and β2 is called L1, etc).

0114
The canonical ligand-binding site is composed of β1, L1, β2, L3, and L6 (exemplified in the crystal structure of PLC-δ1, PDB file 1MAI) and, roughly speaking, is confined to a triangular area with L1, L3, and L6 as the three vertices.

0096
Some positively charged or polar residues that have been previously identified as critical for lipid binding in this ligand-binding triangle are not conserved in APPL1 (Supplementary Figures 1 and 3), consistent with the fact that APPL1 alone lacks membrane binding ability.
0114
In our crystal structure of the APPL1 BAR-PH dimer, the two PH domains are located at the opposite ends of the crescent-shaped dimer, and each has fairly extensive contact with the BAR domain of its symmetry mate (Figure 1).

0419
In our crystal structure of the APPL1 BAR-PH dimer, the two PH domains are located at the opposite ends of the crescent-shaped dimer, and each has fairly extensive contact with the BAR domain of its symmetry mate (Figure 1). The addition of the PH domain expands the BAR dimer in the longest dimension from 140 to 170 Å, but hardly changes the height of the dimer (i.e., the dimension along the two-fold axis direction) and its curvature. Using its β1, β2, L3, and L7 regions, the PH domain contacts the BAR domain of its symmetry mate in two places (Figures 1B, C and 3; Supplementary Figure 3). First, the motif of D15SPxxR20 (where x stands for any aa residue) at the N-terminal of BAR domain contacts β1, β2, and L3 regions of PH domain.

0419
Second, the conserved D334xxDRRYCF342 motif in the loop L7 of the PH domain is directly in contact with the loop connecting α2 and α3 in the BAR domain (Figure 3B).

0419
Thus, in the presence of PH domain, the buried SAS is 50% larger than that of the dimer formed by BAR domain alone (4400 Å2). The canonical ‘ligand'-binding triangle of the PH domain is oriented about 60° from the concave side of the BAR dimmer, so that both the PH triangle and BAR concave surface could be brought within the vicinity of a curved membrane simultaneously.

0107
Nevertheless, as discussed earlier, key residues for lipid interaction are not conserved in APPL1.

0419
The C-terminus of PH is exposed to solvent in the dimer, consistent with the fact that it connects to the C-terminal region including the PTB domain.
0114
Because of the interaction between D15SPxxR20 motif and PH domain, the rest N-terminus peptide (residues 5−12) clearly became ordered in the BAR-PH crystal structure, in comparison to the BAR domain-alone crystal structure, where residues N-terminal to Leu13 were invisible in the electron density map. The fixed N-terminal peptide in the BAR-PH structure has an extended backbone conformation between Met4 (remnant from the His-tag cleavage) and Pro8, followed by a one-turn 310 helix (Figure 3C).

Furthermore, the N-terminus is surrounded by a number of regions from the dimer partner, including the helix α4 and flexible loop connecting α1 and α2 (where residues 76−78 were mobile in the crystal structure).
0419
To investigate roles of the BAR−PH interaction in solution, a double point mutation, S16E/P17E, at the BAR−PH interface was made. These residues are located in the region N-terminal to the BAR domain and form close contacts with β2 and L3 of the PH domain (Figure 3A).

To study APPL1−Rab5 interaction in solution, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mediated pull-down assays. The APPL1 BAR-PH domain (residues 5−385) and a longer fragment with a 40-residue extension downstream of the PH domain, APPL1 (5−419), were each effectively pulled down by GTP-bound GST−Rab5 fusion protein (Figure 4). The APPL1 protein was pulled down by either WT Rab5 preloaded with non-hydrolysable GTP analog (GppNHp) or Rab5-Q79L defective in GTP hydrolysis (with or without preloaded GTP analog), but could not be effectively pulled down by either the WT Rab5 preloaded with GDP or Rab5-S34N defective in GTP binding (Figure 4 and data not shown). In contrast to the BAR-PH domain, we confirmed that APPL1 BAR domain alone (residues 5−265) cannot directly interact with Rab5 (data not shown) (Miaczynska et al, 2004). Furthermore, using different Rab5 truncation variants, we demonstrated that the N-terminus (residues 1−15) and C-terminus (residues 185−215) of Rab5 are dispensable for interaction with APPL1 (Figure 4).

Binding affinity between full-length Rab5-Q79L and APPL1 (5−419) was quantitatively determined in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment. Rab5 was coupled to the SPR biosensor chip in random orientations, and APPL1 (5−419) was applied as the analyte at concentrations of 0.15−12 μM (Supplementary Figure 4). The dissociation constant, kd, for the Rab5−APPL1 interaction measured from this experiment was 0.9 (±0.7) μM, with kon and koff of 1.3 (±0.6) × 103 M−1 s−1, and 1.2 (±0.4) × 10−3 s−1, respectively.
0096
To identify Rab5-binding site(s) in APPL1, GST−Rab5-Q79L (full length) was used to pull down APPL1 variants having surface point mutations. The WT APPL1 (5−419) fragment was used as the parental construct for the mutagenesis, because this fragment is easily distinguishable from GST−Rab5 by size on SDS–PAGE gels without the need for Western blot analysis.

Most of these point mutations were located in the PH domain or near the BAR−PH interface, which are the surface regions most conserved between APPL1 and APPL2 (Supplementary Figure 5). Substitution mutants were designed to maximize potential mutational effects on Rab5 binding (e.g., by flipping charges or switching between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues) without disrupting the overall structure.

Among them, seven mutants, including V25D, N308D, M310K, A318D, G319R, L321D, and D324A, either abolished or significantly reduced (i.e., retaining <30%) Rab5 binding compared with the WT APPL1 (Figure 5A).

0419
In the 3D structure, most of these residues cluster in an elongated surface area formed by β3, L3, and β4 of the PH domain, defining a major Rab5-binding site (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, the effect of the V25D mutant suggests that the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding either directly or indirectly.

0096
On the other hand, L1 loop seems not to be required for Rab5 binding; significance of the apparent, positive effect of the truncation mutant (Figure 5A) remains to be studied.

We further extended these binding studies and confirmed the above Rab5-binding site in vivo in the cell, by monitoring Rab5-mediated APPL1 recruitment to early endosomes in the cell via confocal microscopy.

In this case, the RFP (DsRed-monomer)−Rab5-Q79L fusion protein was expressed in PC12 cells, targeted to the early endosomes, and recruited effectively the coexpressed GFP (green fluorescence protein)−APPL1 to these early endosomes (Figure 5C).

Interaction between small GTPase and BAR domain has been exemplified in a complex crystal structure of Rac and arfaptin2 before (Tarricone et al, 2001). Based on the following observations, however, we excluded the possibility of a Rac−arfaptin2-like binding mode for the Rab5−APPL1 interaction. First, the linear dimension of Rab5 is less than 50 Å, which is significantly smaller than the distance (∼60 Å) between the putative Rab5-binding site in the PH domain and the central region of the BAR dimmer, where Rac binds with arfaptin2. Second, the isolated APPL1 BAR domain did not bind to Rab5 in our pull-down assay. Third, we mutated APPL1 Asn52, which is at the position equivalent to Rac-binding site in arfaptin2, to either a smaller (Ala) or larger (Arg) side-chain residue, and the mutations showed no effect on the binding to Rab5.

Among them, Rab5 and Rab22 share a higher overall sequence identity with each other than with Rab21 (Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2000). This difference was used to explain the ability of Rab5 and Rab22, but not Rab21, to share some common effectors such as EEA1 and rabenosyn5 (Kauppi et al, 2002; Eathiraj et al, 2005). Therefore, we tested APPL1 binding specificity towards other members in the Rab5 subfamily, using GST−Rab21 (full length) and GST−Rab22 (2−192) to pull down APPL1 (5−419). Interestingly, APPL1 would bind to Rab21 in a GTP-dependent manner (Figure 4), indicating that APPL1 is an effector for both Rab5 and Rab21. On the other hand, we were unable to detect any binding between APPL1 and Rab22 in the pull-down assay (Figure 4). We could not rule out possible in vivo interaction between them because our recombinant Rab22 might not have folded correctly in E. coli based on the following observations: (1) the expression level of Rab22 was 10- to 20-fold lower than Rab5 and Rab21, and (2) the GTP loading rate of Rab22 was lower too (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our study on Rab5 and Rab21 for their interactions with APPL1. We demonstrated that Rab21 and Rab5 have similar but not identical binding profiles towards APPL1 variants (Figure 5), which may be explained by their sequence divergence. This differential binding to Rab5 and Rab21 by APPL1 may allow in vivo analysis of the functional roles of each Rab−APPL1 interaction, for example, by specifically abolishing one interaction while retaining others.

Next we investigated the APPL1-binding regions in Rab5. Since residues responsible for APPL1 binding are likely to be located in the switch I, switch II, and interswitch regions, whose conformations change between different nucleotide binding states, these regions became the main objects of our investigation. In addition to relevant Rab5 mutations that we made in previous studies, several point mutations in the Rab5 switch I region (i.e., residues 40−53) were tested for APPL1 binding. We found that point mutations in the 42−48 region significantly reduced APPL1 binding, while L38R, Q49A, E50A, and I53N showed little or no detectable effect (Figure 6A). Consistent with our previous structural studies on Rab5–rabaptin5 interaction (Zhu et al, 2004), all mutations within the 38−50 region did not interfere with Rab5−rabaptin5 binding (Figure 6A). Furthermore, with the knowledge of crystal structures of Rab5–rabaptin5 and Rab22–rabenosyn5 complexes, it is clear that both Rab5 effectors rabaptin5 and rabenosyn5 bind to the so called invariant hydrophobic triad of Rab5 (i.e., Phe57, Trp74, and Tyr89) (Merithew et al, 2001).

Interestingly, in our mutagenesis analysis, the APPL1-binding was affected by W74R and Y89R, but not by F57R point mutation in Rab5 (Figure 6). Taken together, our results indicate that APPL1 binds to Rab5 regions including the 40−48 loop and switch II, ∼30 Å across. In addition, we showed that the two effectors, APPL1 and rapaptin5, could compete for Rab5-binding (data not shown), confirming that the binding sites of APPL1 and rabaptin5 on the Rab5 surface overlap with each other.

To further define the Rab5−APPL1 binding mode, we performed extensive pull-down analyses between variants of Rab5 and APPL1, looking for reversal mutants that could rescue the lost binding ability of others. We identified one such pair; APPL1-N308D abolished the binding to Rab5, while Rab5-L38R had no effect on APPL1 binding. However, Rab5-L38R was found to bind with APPL1-N308D, but not with the other tested APPL1 variants of similar hydrophobic-to-charged mutations, including V25D, A318D, and L321D (Supplementary Figure 6).

0107
Since both APPL1 and APPL2 bind to Rab5, their Rab-binding sites are likely located in a surface region that is conserved between the two APPL proteins. There are no deletion/insertion differences in the BAR-PH region between them (Supplementary Figure 1), and an inspection of the APPL1 BAR-PH dimer surface indicates that the most conserved surface region is located on the PH domain surface and the BAR-PH junction (Supplementary Figure 5). Furthermore, neither PH domain (Miaczynska et al, 2004) nor BAR domain alone (data not shown) can directly bind Rab5, suggesting that the dimer interface between PH and BAR domains plays a critical role in Rab5 binding directly or indirectly. This binding mode between Rab5 and APPL1 is apparently distinct from that between Rac and arfaptin, which only requires BAR dimerization (Tarricone et al, 2001).

For example, a previously reported triple mutation of APPL1 within the PH domain, K280E/Y283C/G319R, disrupts Rab5 binding (Miaczynska et al, 2004). This effect can be fully explained based on the importance of the BAR−PH and PH−Rab5 interfaces.

Based on available information, we have modeled the interaction between the two proteins.

0107
Over 1200 Å2 SAS area combined from both the APPL1 dimer and Rab5 would be buried in their interface. In this putative Rab5−APPL1 binding mode, APPL1 interface includes L2, β3, L3, and β4 regions.

0114
Note that the L3-β4 region showed weak electron density in the crystal structure, indicating its higher mobility and possible adaptability in forming a complex with Rab5. On the Rab5 side, two regions that harbor binding-defective mutations are involved in the complex formation: the loop 42−48 and switch II (Figure 6).

0107
The bound Rab5 molecules would extend the concave surface of the APPL1 dimer, with both the N- and C-termini of Rab5 exposed to solvent. Considering that there are about 30 residues C-terminal to our Rab5 model, which are necessary for membrane association but excluded from the crystallography study, our model would allow Rab5 molecules to anchor to the membrane through the added C-terminal tails and to interact with APPL1 at both ends of the BAR-PH dimer (Figure 7). The Rab5 C-terminal tail is likely flexible, supporting that recruitment of APPL1 to the endocytic vesicle may not require its direct contact with the membrane. In the complex, the Rab5 molecule does not block the C-terminus of the PH domain, allowing peptide extension of the APPL1 molecule from the BAR-PH domain.

In contrast to the α-helix dominant Rab-binding motifs of all other effectors of known 3D structures (Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999; Zhu et al, 2004; Eathiraj et al, 2005; Wu et al, 2005; Wei et al, 2006), the Rab5-binding motif of APPL1 is mainly composed of two β-strands, β3 and β4, and their connecting loop L3.

0096
Although the exact binding position on the Rab protein and orientation of the effector helices may differ among available complex structures, all these Rab-binding domains interact with the invariant hydrophobic triad. However, we have identified a Rab5 mutation in the hydrophobic triad, F57R, that does not interfere with APPL1 binding, but abolishes the binding to another Rab5 effector, rabaptin5 (Figure 6A; Zhu et al, 2004). In contrast, several point mutations in the switch I region of Rab5 affect the binding of APPL1 but not rabaptin5. The 42−48 region in Rab5 has not been previously reported to be involved in effector binding.

So far, only two crystal structures of small GTPase−PH domain complexes are available.

0107
The interactions between the Ran GTPase domain and RanBD1 PH core domain is fairly minor, occurring between the switch I region of the GTPase (equivalent to the 40's in Rab5) and strand β2 of the PH domain. This interaction alone is unlikely to be sufficient to form a stable complex.

0107
These two terminal peptides wrap around the partner proteins forming the major interaction between Ran and RanBD1. Such an interaction seems not to be required for Rab5 and APPL1, because the GTPase domain of Rab5 and BAR-PH domain of APPL1 are sufficient to mediate their interaction.

Our mutagenesis analysis points to a different surface region (β3, L3, and β4) of the PH domain for Rab5 binding. Therefore, the Rab5−APPL1 interaction represents a new GTPase−PH binding mode.

Both APPL1 and APPL2 are identified as Rab5 effectors, and their overall aa sequences are highly homologous. In particular, residues on the APPL1 BAR dimer interface, BAR−PH interface, and the presence of the α4 helix seem well conserved in APPL2 (Supplementary Figure 5).

0419
Based on the APPL1 BAR-PH crystal structure, we find that, in general, the PH domain is more conserved than the BAR domain, and most of the highly conserved positions are located closer to the BAR−PH interface rather than the central region of the symmetric dimer. For example, the two major contact regions between PH and BAR domains (i.e., D15SPxxR20 and D334xxDRRYCF342) are conserved at the aa sequence level among BAR-PH containing proteins.
0114
A similar N-BAR structure was predicted for APPL1 and APPL2 (Habermann, 2004), but our current APPL1 crystal structure does not show such a structural motif.
0419
Lacking both the amphipathic helix N-terminal to the BAR domain and the lipid-binding motif in the PH domain (Supplementary Figure 1) may explain the Rab5-dependent membrane association of APPL1. In contrast, the PH domains of centaurin-β1/2 contain the key, basic residues for phosphoinositide binding (Dinitto and Lambright, 2006; Supplementary Figure 1).

0096
If their PH domains are oriented similarly to that in the APPL1 dimer, the canonical (i.e., L1–L3–L6), ligand-binding triangle in their PH domains likely contributes to direct membrane association of these proteins.
0107
While it is suggested that Rab5−APPL1 interaction mediates a signal transduction pathway between the plasma membrane and the nucleus, the mechanism by which Rab5 binding stimulates APPL1 translocation to the nucleus remains elusive.

The corresponding region in APPL1 is the solvent exposed loop connecting α2 and α3 at the tip of the dimer (Figure 1B) and has a fairly conserved sequence (Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, our preliminary data suggest that there is no detectable binding between the BAR-PH domain and the C-terminal region of APPL1 (data not shown), which makes it unlikely that Rab5 may regulate APPL1 through interference with the intramolecular interaction of the latter. It seems more probable that the Rab5−APPL1 complex recruits downstream effectors to propagate the signal transduction process.

Unlike other Rab effectors, APPL1/2 proteins function in the signaling pathway from the so-called signaling endosome to nucleus. Our data show that APPL1 interacts with the Rab5 protein using a novel binding mode; it remains to be proven whether such a binding mode is essential for APPL1 function. Whereas it has been shown that APPL1 does not bind other Rab proteins miscellaneously (Miaczynska et al, 2004), we demonstrate that APPL1 is also an effector of Rab21, indicating that APPL1 adopts a binding mode shared by both Rab5 and Rab21. It raises the possibility that, besides Rab5, other members of this Rab subfamily may also be involved in the APPL1 signaling pathway.

The SV40 small t antigen (ST) is a potent oncoprotein that perturbs the function of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). ST directly interacts with the PP2A scaffolding A subunit and alters PP2A activity by displacing regulatory B subunits from the A subunit. We have determined the crystal structure of full-length ST in complex with PP2A A subunit at 3.1 Å resolution. ST consists of an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain that contains two zinc-binding motifs. Both the J domain and second zinc-binding motif interact with the intra-HEAT-repeat loops of HEAT repeats 3–7 of the A subunit, which overlaps with the binding site of the PP2A B56 subunit. Intriguingly, the first zinc-binding motif is in a position that may allow it to directly interact with and inhibit the phosphatase activity of the PP2A catalytic C subunit. These observations provide a structural basis for understanding the oncogenic functions of ST.
0114
Specifically, SV40 small t antigen (ST) binds to and perturbs the function of the abundant protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A is a family of heterotrimeric enzymes, composed of a structural A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits. Here we have determined the structure of SV40 ST in complex with the PP2A structural subunit Aα. SV40 ST consists of an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain that contains two separate zinc-binding motifs. SV40 ST binds to the same region of PP2A as the regulatory subunit B56, which provides a structural explanation for the displacement of regulatory B subunits by SV40 ST. Taken together, these observations provide a structural basis for understanding the oncogenic functions of ST.
0114
The crystal structure of full-length SV40 small t antigen (ST) in complex with the A subunit of its target, protein phosphatase 2A, contributes to our understanding of the oncogenic functions of ST.
0114
ST, which shares its N terminus with LT but has a unique C-terminal end, is also a potent oncoprotein that plays a critical role in the transformation of several human cell types [2,3]. For example, the cointroduction of LT, ST, the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), and an oncogenic allele of H-RAS imparts a tumorigenic phenotype to a wide range of primary human cells [4–6]. The tumorigenic activity of ST is strictly dependent on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), since mutant versions of ST that are unable to bind PP2A fail to induce tumorigenic activity [5].
0114
PP2A is a large family of heterotrimeric enzymes that accounts for the majority of total Ser/Thr phosphatase activity in most tissues and cells [7–10]. Although a dimer comprised of a ~65 kDa scaffolding A subunit and a ~36 kDa catalytic C subunit constitutes the core enzymatic activity of PP2A, the binding of a third regulatory B subunit to the AC core enzyme regulates PP2A activity, cellular localization, and substrate specificity. PP2A can exist in cells as either the AC core complex or an ABC heterotrimeric holoenzyme that is the dominant form in most cells. The scaffold A subunit is composed of 15 HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, and target of rapamycin) repeats [11], while the C subunit contains a catalytic domain that shares sequence homology with other Ser/Thr phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin).
0114
In particular, several lines of evidence implicate PP2A as a tumor suppressor gene. Specifically, PP2A inhibitors such as microcystin and okadaic acid are potent tumor promoters and the ST antigen acts as a potent oncogene [12–16].
0114
ST interacts with the PP2A AC core dimer through the direct interaction between ST and the PP2A scaffolding A subunit [23,24]. Prior work has suggested that ST associates with the PP2A C subunit through interactions with the A subunit. While the C subunit interacts with HEAT repeats 11–15 of A subunit, ST interacts with HEAT repeats 3–7, which is also the binding site for PP2A B subunits [25,26]. The ability of ST to displace multiple B subunits from the A subunit has been demonstrated both in vitro [27,28] and in vivo [16,29]. The displacement of B subunits by ST inhibits PP2A activity towards multiple substrates, but increases phosphatase activity towards histone H1 [22,30]. Therefore, ST can be considered as a viral B subunit that changes the biochemical properties of PP2A.

0107
ST interacts with the PP2A AC core dimer through the direct interaction between ST and the PP2A scaffolding A subunit [23,24].
0114
The 174 amino acid ST shares its N-terminal 78 residues with the N-terminal sequence of LT, including a region that exhibits J domain (also termed the DnaJ domain) function [3,31,32]. The unique C-terminal 96 residues of ST antigen interact with the PP2A A subunit. The C-terminal unique domain is rich in Cys residues, six of which are organized into two CxCxxC clusters and bind two zinc ions, providing structural stability to ST [33,34]. The N-terminal J domain is not required for the interaction of ST with the A subunit of PP2A but may contribute to the high affinity binding, since the removal of the first 51 residues from ST caused a 140-fold reduction in inhibition towards the phosphatase activity of PP2A AC core complex [35]. The N-terminal J domain shares sequence homology with the DnaJ family of molecular co-chaperones, which promote the ATPase and chaperone activities of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), an important chaperone in the cell [36,37].

0114
While the structure of the J domain can be predicted from prior structural determinations of LT, the overall structure of ST remains to be unraveled and it is unclear how ST may interact with PP2A and regulate PP2A activities.
0114
The protein complex containing full-length SV40 ST and full length murine PP2A Aα subunit (A-ST complex) were co-expressed in E.

0114
In each complex, the scaffolding A subunit contains 15 HEAT repeats that forms a horseshoe shape. The four A-ST complexes in the asymmetric unit have essentially the same structure, except HEAT repeats 11–15 that show substantial conformational variation (see below). ST contains an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain. These two domains sit on the concave and convex sides of the ridge of the A subunit horseshoe structure, respectively, by interacting with intra-repeat loops of the Aα subunit HEAT repeats 3–7 (Figure 1), which is also the binding site for B56γ1 in the A-B56γ1-C trimeric PP2A holoenzyme structure [25,26].

ST interacts with the intrarepeat loops of HEAT repeats 3–7 of PP2A A subunit.
0114
SV40 ST exhibits an all α-helix structure with two zinc-binding sites in the unique domain (Figure 2A). The J domain contains three helices and has a structure similar to the previously solved crystal structure of the J domain of SV40 LT and a NMR structure of polyomavirus DnaJ-like domain [41,42], with Cα root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.84 and 1.83 Å, respectively.

Interestingly, the expected Hsp70 binding region of the J domain is not involved in the interaction with PP2A A subunit and appears widely accessible to Hsp70.

0114
The linker between helices 2 and 3, which has been implicated in Hsp70 interaction, as well as the linker between J and unique domains (residues 72–86), is not visible in any of the four complexes in the asymmetric unit, suggesting structural flexibility of these two linkers in the A-ST complex.

(A) Structural organization of SV40 ST and the zinc coordination of ST unique domain.
0114
The ST unique domain is composed of four helices.

0114
These two zinc-binding motifs are completely distinct from the previously proposed GAL4-type zinc cluster for ST and are also different from classical zinc finger structures [33,34,43].
0107
Pro28 and Ile163 make a hydrophobic interaction between two domains (Figure 2B).

0114
Therefore, the J and unique domains of ST are structurally coupled and ST consists of one globular fold. Since residues in the A-ST interface are highly conserved among ST proteins (Figure 2C), this domain organization should be conserved among ST proteins in the polyomavirus family.
0114
The interactions between the Aα subunit and SV40 ST are formed through the intra-loop regions of repeats 3 to 7 in the Aα subunit (Figures 1 and 3).

0114
ST uses both its J domain and the second zinc-binding motif (in particular the L6 loop) for interacting with PP2A Aα subunit, while the first zinc finger is not directly involved in interactions with PP2A Aα subunit, but may be involved in interactions with PP2A catalytic C subunit (see below). One notable feature of this interaction is that five of eight residues in the ST unique domain (Figures 2C and 3) in the A-ST interface interact with the Aα subunit through the backbone of those residues. The backbone conformations of those ST residues (Leu133, Met146, Trp147, Phe148, and Gly149) are largely determined by the second zinc-binding site, demonstrating the importance of the second zinc-binding site in the Aα subunit interaction. In contrast, all of the Aα subunit residues interact with ST through their side chains, and some of those residues were identified by previous A subunit mutagenesis studies [44].
0114
Color assignment for different subunit or domains is the same as in Figure 1. Hydrogen bonds between ST and the PP2A A subunit are indicated by dashed lines.
0114
When the A-ST complex structure is superimposed with the previously reported A-B56-C PP2A holoenzyme structure [25,26], it is obvious that ST and the B56 subunit interact with the same region of PP2A A subunit and have very similar “footprints” on the scaffold A subunit (Figure 4A).

0114
The position of the indole ring of Trp140 is flipped between these two complex structures, mostly due to the intercalation of Pro132 of ST between Trp140 and Phe141 by forming a hydrophobic core (Figures 3 and 4B). The largely overlapping Aα binding sites of ST and B56 explains how ST competes with B56 for the binding of the Aα subunit [25,26].
0114
(A) Structural superposition of these two complexes. These two complexes are superimposed using A subunit HEAT repeats 2–10. The J and unique domain of ST are colored green and pink, respectively.

0114
It is clear that ST and B56γ1 bind to the same sites on PP2A A subunit.
0114
(B) The PP2A A subunit residues involved in both ST and B56γ1 interactions. ST and B56γ1 share a common footprint on the ridge of A subunit.
0114
In the A-B56-C PP2A holoenzyme structure, both B56 and C subunits sit on the same side (intra-repeat loop side) of the horseshoe shape formed by the scaffolding A subunit [25,26]. When HEAT repeats 2–10 in the A-ST complex are superimposed with corresponding regions of the A-B56-C complex, the first zinc-binding motif, in particular helix α4 and its flanking region, is in close proximity to the C subunit active site (Figure 5). The closest atoms between ST and C subunit in this superposition are within van der Waals distances. It should be noted that, when the A-ST complex structure is superimposed with the PP2A AC core complex, the distance between the ST first zinc-binding motif and C subunit appears further apart than in the A-B56-C holoenzyme. However, since the PP2A A subunit has substantial structural flexibility (see below), it is plausible that ST may interact directly with the C subunit near its catalytic active site, just like the B56 subunit that interacts with both A and C subunits.
0114
The PP2A catalytic subunit is shown in the surface model. The active site of the PP2A C subunit is indicated.
0114
(A) The structural alignment of PP2A A subunits. PP2A A subunit structures were aligned based on their structures of HEAT repeats 2–10. PP2A A subunit structures that used for the alignment are from the four A-ST complexes in the asymmetric unit, the A subunit structure alone (PDB code: 1B3U), the AC dimer structure (PDB code: 2IE3), and the A-B56-C trimeric structure (PDB code: 2IAE). The HEAT repeats 2–10 may form a rigid structural block since no significant structural variations were observed for this region among all A subunit structures.
0114
(B) The amplitude of conformational variations of the PP2A A subunit HEAT repeats 11–15.
0114
(C) HEAT repeats 13–15 may form the other relatively rigid structural block in the PP2A A subunit. There is no major conformational variation in HEAT repeats 13–15 among all A subunit structures. Therefore, the structural variations observed in (A) and (B) are mostly due to the conformational flexibility of HEAT repeats 10–13.
0114
(D) Superposition of PP2A A subunit structures from Aα alone, A-ST complex, and A-B56-C trimeric complex. The structure of the PP2A A subunit in the A-ST complex can have a conformation very similar with that of the A subunit in the A-B56-C trimeric complex.

To determine whether the amino acid residues observed in our structure to be interaction points between ST and Aα, we generated a set of ST (R7A, R21A, P132A, and W147A) and Aα (D177A, R183A, E216A, Q217A, and R258A) mutants and performed in vitro binding assays. We found that substitution of alanine for residues Arg7, Arg21, or Pro132 of ST abrogated interaction between ST and wild-type Aα (Figure 7).

The Aα subunit of PP2A consists of 15 HEAT repeats, with each repeat containing two antiparallel helices. Overall the PP2A Aα subunit forms a horseshoe shape structure. SV40 ST “rides” on the structural ridge formed by intra-HEAT-repeat loops of PP2A Aα subunit (Figure 1). Previous work has demonstrated that the unique domain of SV40 ST is the essential binding domain for PP2A AC core complex [5]. In our structure the second zinc-binding motif, in particular the L6 loop, forms extensive interactions with the PP2A Aα subunit. In support of our structural observations, in vitro structure-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the interface between the second zinc-binding motif, in particular Pro132 that intercalates between Trp140 and Phe141 of PP2A A subunit, is essential for A-ST interactions (Figure 7). Point mutations of two residues in the ST J domain (R7A and R21A), or mutation of an A subunit residue that forms a hydrogen bond with ST Arg21 (E216A, Figure 3), all abolish the A-ST interaction (Figure 7), confirming the J domain is directly involved in A subunit interaction. In addition, this structure is completely consistent with previous mutagenesis studies of PP2A A subunit [44], since essentially all A subunit mutations that have weaker ST binding activities map to the A-ST interface in our structure.
0114
Consistent with prior reports [23,24], we failed to observe stable direct interaction between purified ST and PP2A C subunit using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay (unpublished data). It is possible that ST directly interacts with the C subunit via the formation of a stable complex between ST and the A subunit. Therefore, ST may form trivalent interactions with the PP2A AC complex—two of them (via the J domain and the second zinc-binding motif) interacting with the A subunit, and the third one (via the first zinc-binding motif) binding to the C subunit. This hypothesis explains why the first zinc-binding motif does not directly interact with PP2A A subunit, yet is required for the interaction with and the inhibition of phosphatase activity of PP2A AC core complex [35]. This model is also supported by the observation that ST fragments containing both J domain and the first but not the second zinc-binding motif interact with PP2A AC complex and inhibit PP2A AC dimer phosphatase activity [29,35]. ST may interfere with substrate binding via its interaction near the active site of the C subunit. Therefore, in addition to competing with the PP2A B subunit for PP2A A subunit binding, ST may directly modulate the phosphatase activity of the AC core complex, which accounts for substantial proportion of PP2A enzyme in the cell. Future work will be needed to understand if and how ST may directly interact with the C subunit.

0107
Consistent with prior reports [23,24], we failed to observe stable direct interaction between purified ST and PP2A C subunit using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay (unpublished data).
0114
Prior studies have demonstrated that the unique domain but not the J domain was sufficient for interaction with PP2A AC complex. Although not essential for A-ST interaction, the deletion of the J domain significantly decreased the inhibitory activity of ST on the PP2A AC core dimer [35], suggesting that the J domain enhances the binding of ST to the PP2A A subunit. Consistent with this view, mutation of either Arg7 or Arg21, two residues on the J domain surface involved in PP2A A interaction, disrupts the interaction between ST and A subunit. Alternatively, the J domain may play a role in stabilizing the spatial position of the first zinc-binding motif by allowing its efficient interaction with the C subunit. This interaction may be particularly important in the AC-ST complex formation, because the structural flexibility of HEAT repeats 10–13 of the A subunit may not permit the C subunit to stay in a fixed position and interact with ST efficiently. Indeed, although the unique domain of ST binds to PP2A A, this binding fails to inhibit PP2A AC phopshatase activity [35].

0107
Consistent with this view, mutation of either Arg7 or Arg21, two residues on the J domain surface involved in PP2A A interaction, disrupts the interaction between ST and A subunit.
0114
In this regard, we note that the second zinc-binding motif binds to the A subunit primarily through loop–loop interactions and on the concave side of the A subunit structure only, while the J domain interacts with the convex side of A subunit. While the second zinc-binding motif may be the primary docking site, the J domain may fix the relative orientation between ST unique domain and the A subunit, with the N-terminal J and C-terminal unique domains sitting on the convex and concave side of the horseshoe shape, respectively. This orientation stabilization may be important for the first zinc-binding motif to effectively inhibit the phosphatase activity of the PP2A C subunit.
0114
In summary, our structural and biochemical studies reveal the structure of the ST family and define the interaction between ST and the A subunit of PP2A. In addition, our work suggests that ST may directly interact and regulate the activity or substrate specificity of the PP2A catalytic C subunit, and Hsp70 may bind to PP2A-bound ST and thus define PP2A activity and/or substrate specificity. Taken together, our work provides a structural basis for the oncogenic activity of ST and MT antigens in the polyomavirus family. Since ST binds to PP2A Aα in a manner similar to that used by the regulatory B subunits, these findings provide not only new insights into the regulation of PP2A but may also provide a foundation for the development of small molecules that alter the function of PP2A.

Full-length SV40 ST (strain VA45‐54‐2) and full-length mouse PP2A Aα subunit with tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) cleavage sites were cloned into pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Biotech, http://www.gelifesciences.com) and pET28a vector (Novagen, http://www.emdbiosciences.com/html/NVG/home.html), respectively, and co-transformed into E.

coli strain BL21 (star) (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com). Mouse and human Aα subunits are identical in protein sequence, except for one residue that is distant from the ST binding site (Ser324 in human, Thr324 in mouse).

0114
Coexpression of Aα subunit and SV40 ST was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6 upon shifting the temperature from 37 °C to 18 °C, and cells were grown for an additional 18 h.

0071
Soluble fractions were filtered with 0.8 μm syringe filters and applied into a Ni-NTA affinity column pre-equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol.

Target protein complexes (the Aα subunit with GST-tag and SV40 ST with His-tag) were eluted with elution buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT.

0114
Fractions of the heterodimeric complex of full-length Aα subunit and full-length SV40 ST were pooled and concentrated up to 10 mg/ml and used for the crystallization trial. Crystals of the A-ST complex were obtained at room temperature with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.
0114
Initial molecular replacement was performed with Phaser [49] by using the Aα subunit structure in the trimeric PP2A complex [25] as the search model.

0114
Since SV40 ST was demonstrated to contain two zinc-binding sites [34] that gave significant anomalous signal at the experimental wavelength (λ = 1.000 Å), the same dataset was scaled as an anomalous dataset using HKL2000. The anomalous difference map, calculated using phases derived from the refined molecular replacement solution, gave the positions of eight zinc sites (for four ST molecules in the asymmetric unit) without any ambiguity.

0114
The final structural models of ST contain residues 1–44, 48–78, 85–172 (chain e); 1–40, 49–74, 87–172 (chain f); 1–41, 51–70, 92–172 (chain g); and 1–41, 51–73, 94–172 (chain h).

Furthermore, UXT forms a dynamic complex with NF-κB and is recruited to the NF-κB enhanceosome upon stimulation. Interestingly, the UXT protein level correlates with constitutive NF-κB activity in human prostate cancer cell lines. The presence of NF-κB within the nucleus of stimulated or constitutively active cells is considerably diminished with decreased endogenous UXT levels. Our results reveal that UXT is an integral component of the NF-κB enhanceosome and is essential for its nuclear function, which uncovers a new mechanism of NF-κB regulation.

Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a widely expressed primary transcription factor composed of a heterodimeric complex (p65–p50). A myriad of unrelated exogenous and endogenous stimuli are capable of inducing NF-κB activity.

Recent progress has shed light on the importance of nuclear events in shaping the strength and duration of the NF-κB transcriptional response, which is achieved partly by posttranslational modification of the NF-κB transcription factor complex or the histones that surround various NF-κB target genes (Chen and Greene, 2004). For example, I κ-B kinase α (IKKα) was demonstrated to accelerate both the turnover of NF-κB and its removal from proinflammatory gene promoters (Lawrence et al., 2005). This kinase could also phosphorylate histone H3 and was critical for NF-κB–responsive gene expression (Yamamoto et al., 2003).

Consequently, no UXT was coimmunoprecipitated from this nuclear extract even though there existed a large amount of UXT. In contrast, there exhibited a strong interaction between nuclear p65 and UXT upon TNF-α stimulation. Furthermore, we tested whether endogenous UXT and p65 could interact in response to TNF-α.

Because the RHD of p65 consisted of two Ig-like domains (Chen et al., 1998), we made two additional deletion mutants of p65 (amino acids 1–190 and 191–551), each of which contained only one Ig-like domain.

In addition, we generated several point mutations of UXT and did not observe a considerable change on UXT and p65 interaction. We also had attempted in vain to express truncation mutants of UXT in mammalian cells, which prevented us from further dissecting UXT.

In contrast, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1, a transcription factor unrelated to the Rel family, did not have any affinity to UXT. This phenomenon suggested that UXT recognized a consensus structure fold and that there was probably a unified theme for its interaction with p65 and other members of the Rel family.

Alternatively, we explored whether overexpressing UXT had any measurable effects on inducible genes such as A20 or interleukin-8 (IL-8) that were regulated by NF-κB. On transfection of UXT alone, we did not observe any change on the basal expression of these two genes (unpublished data). Thus, we transfected 293T cells with UXT or IκBα super repressor (SR) and analyzed the amount of A20 or IL-8 mRNA induced by TNF-α, respectively, via quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

Because we failed via overexpressing UXT to convincingly demonstrate the involvement of UXT in NF-κB regulation, we turned to investigate the effect if endogenous UXT expression was reduced via RNAi. Two UXT siRNAs were fished out, which are designated as 242 and 428 hereafter.

To make it more physiologically relevant, we also investigated how the induction of NF-κB–dependent genes (IL-8, A20, and IκBα) was influenced by knocking down endogenous UXT expression. For cells transfected with control siRNA or UXT siRNA, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure endogenous mRNA levels of IL-8, A20, and IκBα induced by TNF-α during a time course.

As was stated in the Introduction, NF-κB activation involved a series of molecular events both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. To rule out the possibility that UXT might act on processes other than directly on NF-κB itself, we examined the effects of UXT knockdown on the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα.

0412
We did not find any differences in this regard between UXT-deficient and normal cells during TNF-α stimulation (Fig.

0413
This was further supported by the observation that IKK kinase activity was not affected at all in terms of UXT knockdown (unpublished data). Given that UXT was expressed almost exclusively inside the nucleus and interacted directly with NF-κB, these data strongly indicate that UXT performed its function via targeting NF-κB itself.
0413
Knockdown of UXT attenuates the activity and amount of nuclear NF-κB.

0412
Via EMSA, we then analyzed endogenous NF-κB DNA binding activity in cells with reduced UXT expression. Expectedly, TNF-α alone induced endogenous NF-κB to bind to its cognate probe strongly and specifically. Considerably, this interaction was markedly diminished in nuclear extracts from UXT-specific knockdown cells.

0413
To substantiate this finding, we took advantage of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to examine whether binding of NF-κB to its endogenous promoter was influenced in vivo when the expression of UXT was diminished. Consistently, deficiency of the endogenous UXT level resulted in considerable decreases in the amount of p65 associated with its endogenous cognate promoters upon TNF-α stimulation. In addition, this was also true for other components of the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome such as p50 and RNA polymerase II.

A previous study has predicted UXT as an α-class PFD family protein via computer modeling (Gstaiger et al., 2003). Some members of this family were previously found to assemble into a hexameric complex that functioned as a molecular chaperone in protein folding and stability (Vainberg et al., 1998).

Some members of this family were previously found to assemble into a hexameric complex that functioned as a molecular chaperone in protein folding and stability (Vainberg et al., 1998).

0413
Thus, we hypothesized that UXT performed its function by serving as a specific molecular chaperone for NF-κB inside the nucleus.
0412
Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with or without the indicated siRNAs and stimulated with or without TNF-α as shown. Interestingly, the amount of nuclear p65 was markedly diminished in cells that were treated with siRNA against UXT even though these cells were stimulated with TNF-α.

0413
The transcription factor sp1 as a negative control was expressed constitutively inside the nucleus and remained intact in response to UXT knockdown. The cytoplasmic reservoir of p65 did not seem to be affected by siRNA against UXT (Fig.

0413
This suggested that UXT positively regulated p65 inside the nucleus, and the loss of it affected the sustained action of p65 in the nucleus, which led to the attenuated EMSA results as observed in Fig.

0413
Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65.

0426
Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65. Approximately 90% of control cells displayed p65 inside the nucleus upon stimulation, whereas only 35–50% displayed p65 in the case of the UXT knockdown specimen (Fig.

0413
Collectively, these data indicate that UXT is a stabilizing factor for the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome.
0413
One possible mechanism for the aforementioned phenomenon is that the loss of UXT releases NF-κB from the enhanceosome, which consequently causes NF-κB to be exported out into the cytoplasm.

0030
To address this hypothesis, leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export (Ullman et al., 1997; Ghosh and Karin, 2002), was used.

0413
Cells were transfected with siRNA against UXT and stimulated with TNF-α in the presence or absence of LMB.

6 B, the expression of UXTr rescued the loss of nuclear p65 caused by endogenous UXT impairment, whereas the expression of wild-type UXT failed to do so. This rescuing effect was also confirmed with EMSA assays (Fig.

After 24 h, cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for determining exogenous UXT protein levels. (B) 293T cells were transfected with the indicated exogenous UXT and siRNAs.

0413
Given that UXT interacted with p65 and was essential to maintain the presence of NF-κB inside the nucleus, we wondered whether UXT was an integral component of the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome in vivo.

0412
To address this possibility, we transfected HA-UXT into 293T cells and performed systematic ChIP assays on the promoters of A20 and IκBα as described in Materials and methods.

0413
It turned out that UXT was indeed present within the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome.

We also stimulated 293T cells and performed similar ChIP assays to confirm again that endogenous UXT was recruited onto the NF-κB enhanceosome in response to stimulation (Fig.

0413
Stimulation of 293T cells with TNF-α led to a strong NF-κB DNA-binding band composed of κB probe, NF-κB, and its cofactors in EMSA. Interestingly, this EMSA band was markedly diminished when antibody against UXT was introduced into the reaction mixture (Fig. 7 C), which strongly suggests that UXT is an integral component in this band and that it is of importance to foster an NF-κB conformation amenable to its binding. Collectively, these data indicate that UXT forms a dynamic complex with p65 in vivo and is recruited to the NF-κB enhanceosome after stimulation.

0413
The NF-κB enhanceosome consisted of a growing list of transcriptional cofactors. Our current finding that UXT was one of them and that it was able to maintain the stability of the NF-κB enhanceosome led us to ask whether other factors could also accomplish this function. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is known to be a transcriptional cofactor in the NF-κB enhanceosome.

However, immunofluorescence and EMSA experiments indicated that the knockdown of CARM1 did not affect the nuclear presence of p65 (Fig. 7, E and F), which suggested that UXT played a unique role toward NF-κB function.

It was well established that NF-κB promotes the survival of most cells through the transcriptional induction of antiapoptotic genes (Barkett and Gilmore, 1999; Zong et al., 1999). Normally, 293T cells would not display apoptotic phenomenon in the presence of TNF-α (<3%). However, loss of NF-κB function would make cells prone to apoptosis. This was confirmed by knocking down UXT upon TNF-α stimulation (∼15%; unpublished data).

Cycloheximide (CHX) is a potent protein synthesis inhibitor. However, at the concentration of ≤10 μg/ml, CHX only reduces but does not completely block de novo protein synthesis (Tang et al., 2001). Interestingly, a low concentration of CHX could dramatically augment the apoptotic effects (Yeh et al., 1997; Kelliher et al., 1998).

In this progress, NF-κB activity started to behave out of control (Chen and Sawyers, 2002; Zerbini et al., 2003).

For example, p300/CBP played a major role in the acetylation of p65 in vivo (Chen et al., 2002). Conversely, acetylated p65 was subjected to deacetylation by HDAC3 (Chen et al., 2001). Recent work also revealed that SIRT1 physically interacted with p65 and promoted p65 deacetylation (Yeung et al., 2004).

Regulating the duration of the nuclear presence of p65 is another potential mechanism to modulate the NF-κB transcriptional response. In this study, we characterized UXT as a novel and essential cofactor for NF-κB function in its enhanceosome.

0412
Because UXT was almost exclusively present inside the nucleus, we reasoned that only after NF-κB translocation into the nucleus could this interaction take place, which was also substantiated by the observation that NF-κB was constitutively inside the nucleus in PC-3 cells and regulated by UXT as a result.

(4) Overexpression of UXT caused marginal synergic inductions of both A20 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. We reasoned that there was a sufficient amount of endogenous UXT within the nucleus in 293T cells so that it would be difficult to demonstrate the synergic effect more dramatically.

We reasoned that there was a sufficient amount of endogenous UXT within the nucleus in 293T cells so that it would be difficult to demonstrate the synergic effect more dramatically. Convincingly, RNAi of UXT resulted in apparent attenuations of NF-κB–responsive reporter expression by various stimuli and, ultimately, the inducible expression of genes tightly regulated by NF-κB. (5) The reduction of endogenous UXT tamed cells prone to apoptosis that was induced by TNF-α, which is a known index for the impairment of NF-κB function. (6) PC-3 cells displayed constitutive NF-κB activity inside the nucleus. This was nicely correlated with the elevated presence of both NF-κB and UXT within the nucleus, which was also consistently substantiated by the loss of NF-κB and its activity when endogenous UXT was diminished in PC-3 cells. Thus, UXT might function to extend the duration of NF-κB or its enhanceosome inside the nucleus.

We have generated several point mutations of UXT (C75A, L32P, L50P, L59P, and L32P/L50P/L59P) and did not reveal any substantial correlation between UXT and p65 interaction. Our speculation is that a three-dimensional juxtaposed motif may be involved in this interaction.

Structural analysis of UXT and NF-κB interaction is under way in our laboratory, and hopefully this will shed light on how UXT performs this regulatory role.

Recently, studies suggested that the ubiquitin–proteasomal degradation pathway was also involved in stringent control of the promoter-bound p65 (Ryo et al., 2003; Saccani et al., 2004). An NF-κB coactivator, Pin1, was found to bind p65 and prevent SOCS-1–mediated ubiquitination (Ryo et al., 2003). We have tried to address whether the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is critical for p65 stability in the context of UXT, but no conclusion can be made as of now.

The few papers that reported nuclear p65 ubiquitination often used the overexpression of p65 to answer this question, which was a controversial approach. After this method, we did observe traces of p65 ubiquitination when UXT was knocked down (unpublished data), which was comparable with published reports (Ryo et al., 2003). However, we believe it is too early to correlate the loss of UXT with p65 ubiquitination.

Substantially, we found that LMB, a specific inhibitor of nuclear export, increased the nuclear accumulation of p65 even though the endogenous UXT was knocked down. More likely, UXT influenced p65 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.

Given the findings from this study, we favor the notion that UXT is a nuclear chaperone that promotes formation of the NF-κB enhanceosome.

For example, a nuclear chaperone termed FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) could facilitate transcript elongation through nucleosomes (Orphanides et al., 1998). Another human nuclear chaperone (bZIP-enhancing factor) promoted the transcriptional activity of bZIP (basic region–leucine zipper DNA-binding domain) proteins (Virbasius et al., 1999). JDP2 was recently demonstrated to be a chaperone for AP1 (Jin et al., 2006).

Numerous reports have documented considerable correlations between NF-κB activation and specific types of cancer (for review see Rayet and Gelinas, 1999). By promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, NF-κB could tip the balance between proliferation and apoptosis toward malignant behavior in tumor cells (for review see Rayet and Gelinas, 1999).

Collectively, our study reveals that UXT is an integral component of the NF-κB enhanceosome and is essential for its function in the nucleus. UXT may function as a specific molecular chaperone for NF-κB in this process. Future investigations will focus on how UXT interacts with NF-κB and regulates the dynamic processes of NF-κB within the nucleus.

Post-translational regulation of CO is crucial for this response by stabilizing the protein at the end of a LD, whereas promoting its degradation throughout the night under LD and SD. We show that mutations in CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a component of a ubiquitin ligase, cause extreme early flowering under SDs, and that this is largely dependent on CO activity. Furthermore, transcription of the CO target gene FT is increased in cop1 mutants and decreased in plants overexpressing COP1 in phloem companion cells. COP1 and CO interact in vivo and in vitro through the C-terminal region of CO. COP1 promotes CO degradation mainly in the dark, so that in cop1 mutants CO protein but not CO mRNA abundance is dramatically increased during the night. However, in the morning CO degradation occurs independently of COP1 by a phytochrome B-dependent mechanism. Thus, COP1 contributes to day length perception by reducing the abundance of CO during the night and thereby delaying flowering under SDs.

Within this pathway, the transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) has an important function by promoting flowering specifically under LDs. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a major regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis (Deng et al, 1992), negatively regulates CO protein abundance in the vascular tissue of adult plants as part of the mechanism by which Arabidopsis discriminates between LD and SD during flowering-time control.

CO contains two B-box-type zinc-finger motifs near its N terminus and a CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1) domain at its C terminus (Putterill et al, 1995). The latter domain is plant specific, but shows similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the HAP2 subunit of the CCAAT box-binding complex, suggesting that CO might bind to DNA directly (Wenkel et al, 2006).

0030
These genes encode RAF kinase inhibitor-like proteins that exert an effect as potent inducers of flowering (Kardailsky et al, 1999; Kobayashi et al, 1999). CO activates FT in the companion cells of the phloem within the vascular tissue, and FT protein is then proposed to move through the phloem sieve elements to the shoot apical meristem (An et al, 2004; Corbesier et al, 2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; Mathieu et al, 2007), where it changes gene expression patterns and induces flowering (Abe et al, 2005; Wigge et al, 2005; Searle et al, 2006).

CO transcription is regulated by the circadian clock so that its expression rises around 12 h after dawn and stays high until the following dawn (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001). Exposure to light between 10 and 14 h after dawn further promotes CO transcription through the activity of the photoreceptor FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) and its interacting partner GIGANTEA (GI) (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001; Imaizumi et al, 2003; Sawa et al, 2007). At the post-translational level, CO protein is stabilized when plants are exposed to light, whereas in darkness CO protein is rapidly degraded through ubiquitination and the activity of the proteasome. These mechanisms combine to ensure that a peak in CO protein abundance occurs under LDs when plants are exposed to light between 10 and 16 h after dawn, whereas under SD, when plants are exposed to darkness during this interval, CO protein does not accumulate (Valverde et al, 2004). The importance of ubiquitination and degradation of CO protein by the proteasome in these processes was demonstrated by use of proteasome inhibitors.
0030
Mutations in the genes encoding the photoreceptors phytochrome A (phyA) and cryptochrome 2 (cry2) delay flowering, and these mutations also reduce the accumulation of CO protein (Valverde et al, 2004). Similarly, far-red light or blue light promotes flowering and stabilizes CO protein, and these regions of the spectrum activate phyA and cry2, respectively.
0030
COP1 is a major negative regulator of photomorphogenic responses, so that cop1 mutants undergo photomorphogenesis in darkness in the absence of photoreceptor activation (Deng et al, 1991). COP1 encodes a RING finger protein with a coiled-coil motif and WD40 repeats (Deng et al, 1992), and exerts an effect as a ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of transcription factors implicated in seedling photomorphogenesis (Osterlund et al, 2000). In mammalian and plant cells, COP1 seems to exert an effect as part of a complex that also includes DEETIOLATED 1 (DET1), DAMAGED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (DDB1), cullin 4A and RING BOX 1 (RBX1) (Chory et al, 1989; Schroeder et al, 2002; Wertz et al, 2004; Hoecker, 2005; Chen et al, 2006).

However, the SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 1 (SPA) family of proteins is plant specific, related in sequence to COP1 and modulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1.

Several protein targets for COP1 are transcription factors that regulate seedling photomorphogenesis (Osterlund et al, 2000; Seo et al, 2003; Duek et al, 2004; Jang et al, 2005; Yang et al, 2005).
0030
In addition, spa1 mutants flower early and SPA proteins modulate CO abundance so that in spa1 spa3 spa4 triple mutants 16 h after dawn under LDs increased levels of CO protein were detected (Ishikawa et al, 2006; Laubinger et al, 2006).

Here, we analysed the role of COP1 in the light regulation of flowering time by genetic and molecular studies. We show that COP1 represses CO activity in the vascular tissue, and reduces CO protein levels particularly under SDs and in the dark, thereby facilitating a flowering response to day length.

In WT plants, CO promotes early flowering under LDs but not SDs. To test whether the early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under SDs was caused by activation of CO under these conditions, the cop1–4 co-10 double mutant was constructed and its flowering time was measured. The double mutant flowered after forming around 30 leaves more than cop1–4 mutants under SDs, demonstrating that CO has an important role in the early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under SDs (Figure 1B and C). Nevertheless, cop1–4 co-10 plants formed 20 leaves fewer than co-10 plants under these conditions, indicating that part of the early flowering of the cop1–4 mutant occurs independently of CO. Under LDs, cop1–4 co-10 plants also flowered at a time intermediate between co-10 and cop1–4 (Figure 1A and C). These genetic results suggest that COP1 exerts an effect as a negative regulator of CO under SDs, so that CO promotes flowering of cop1–4 mutants but not WT plants under SDs.

To test whether COP1 also regulates flowering from the phloem, COP1 or HA:COP1 was expressed from the SUC2 promoter, which is active specifically in the phloem companion cells (Imlau et al, 1999). The SUC2:COP1 transgene was introduced into WT Columbia plants and into cop1–4 mutants, whereas SUC2:HA:COP1 was introduced into SUC2:CO plants. SUC2:COP1 delayed flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, and of WT plants under LDs (Figure 1D–G). Therefore, COP1 exerts an effect in the companion cells, where CO is expressed, to delay flowering.

However, SUC2:COP1 cop1–4 plants still flower earlier than WT plants under SDs, suggesting that COP1 expression in companion cells is not sufficient to completely rescue the early-flowering phenotype of cop1–4 mutants, and therefore that COP1 probably also exerts an effect in additional cell types to delay flowering.

0019
The observation that SUC2:HA:COP1 delays flowering of SUC2:CO plants under LDs and SDs supports the idea that the delay of flowering associated with SUC2:COP1 is at least in part caused by reduction of CO activity (Figure 1G). Taken together, the flowering-time phenotypes of plants misexpressing COP1 in the phloem are consistent with the idea that COP1 exerts an effect in the phloem companion cells to repress the promotion of flowering by CO.

FT transcription is activated by CO and likely represents a direct target of CO protein (Samach et al, 2000; Wigge et al, 2005).

Therefore, if COP1 exerts an effect to repress CO activity this should be reflected in reduced FT mRNA levels.

The effects of COP1 on CO transcription and CO activity were tested by analysing CO and FT mRNA levels at 4-h intervals for 24 h in SD-grown plants of different genotypes (Figure 2A and B). In WT Columbia, CO mRNA was detected during the night under SDs, but was absent in co-10 and cop1–4 co-10 plants as expected due to the T-DNA insertion present in the CO gene in the co-10 allele (Materials and methods). In cop1–4 mutants, the CO mRNA pattern is similar to that observed in WT plants but rises earlier, appearing weakly 8 h after dawn, whereas in WT plants CO mRNA was first detected 12 h after dawn. In contrast, FT mRNA was detected in cop1–4 mutants but not WT plants, consistent with the early flowering of these mutants under SDs.

Similarly, under LDs, FT mRNA levels were much higher in cop1–4 plants than in WT plants consistent with the earlier flowering of the mutants under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 1).

0019
However, under LDs, CO mRNA was consistently detected at lower levels in cop1–4 mutants than in WT plants (Supplementary Figure 1). The expression of FT mRNA in cop1–4 mutants requires CO activity, as demonstrated by the absence of FT mRNA in cop1–4 co-10 plants (Figure 2A). These results are consistent with the idea that COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs, and to a lesser extent under LDs, by repressing CO activity and thereby preventing FT expression.

0019
The abundance of FT mRNA was also tested in transgenic plants expressing COP1 or HA:COP1 mRNAs at high levels in the phloem companion cells from the SUC2 promoter (Figure 2C–E). CO and FT mRNA levels were compared through a LD time course in SUC2:COP1 and WT plants. CO mRNA levels were very similar in both genotypes at all times, whereas FT mRNA levels were severely reduced in SUC2:COP1 plants (Figure 2E), consistent with the overexpression of COP1 in phloem companion cells leading to a reduction in CO activity at the post-transcriptional level. Similarly, 16 h after dawn under SDs, when FT mRNA reaches peak levels in cop1–4 mutants (Figure 2A), SUC2:COP1 cop1–4 plants displayed severely reduced levels of FT mRNA (Figure 2C). Finally, in SUC2:HA:COP1 SUC2:CO plants the level of FT mRNA was lower than in the SUC2:CO progenitor plants, but the level of CO mRNA was unaffected (Figure 2D). Therefore, analysis of FT mRNA in these transgenic plants supports the conclusion that COP1 delays flowering by repressing at the post-transcriptional level the capacity of CO to promote FT transcription in the phloem companion cells.

The observation that the ubiquitin ligase COP1 represses CO-mediated activation of FT suggested that CO might be a substrate for COP1. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated whether COP1 was able to physically interact with CO. In the yeast two-hybrid system, we detected no interaction between CO and COP1, although an interaction between COP1 and the CO-related protein CO-LIKE3 (COL3) was previously detected by this method (Datta et al, 2006), and we were able to confirm this interaction. Therefore, whether COP1 and CO interact in vitro was tested using a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 3). COP1 attached to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD:COP1) and CO were made in an in vitro transcription/translation system and combined. GAD:COP1 was precipitated with anti-GAD antibody and CO was co-precipitated with GAD:COP1 (Figure 3).

In the yeast two-hybrid system, we detected no interaction between CO and COP1, although an interaction between COP1 and the CO-related protein CO-LIKE3 (COL3) was previously detected by this method (Datta et al, 2006), and we were able to confirm this interaction.

0055
These experiments suggest that CO interacts with COP1 in the GAD:COP1 fusion protein. Fragments of CO were also combined with GAD:COP1 to determine which regions of CO are required for the interaction with COP1. Two segments of CO were tested: one containing the region between amino acids 107 and 373, which was called COΔB-box because it did not contain the zinc-finger B-boxes found at the N terminus of CO, and a second containing the region between amino acids 1 and 331, which was named COΔCCT, because the CCT domain near the C terminus of CO was removed.

0055
Therefore, the N-terminal region containing the B-boxes is not required for interaction with COP1, suggesting that the interaction with COP1 is mediated by the C-terminal region of CO that contains the CCT domain.
0019
Whether the interaction between CO and COP1 also occurred in vivo in plant cells was tested using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET). Microprojectile bombardment was used to co-express cyan fluorescent protein (CFP):COP1 and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP):CO in leaf epidermal cells of Arabidopsis. CFP:COP1 and YFP:CO colocalized to the nucleus and also colocalized in speckles within the nucleus (Figure 4A and B). Physical interaction of CFP:COP1 and YFP:CO was tested by measuring FRET using photoacceptor bleaching, as previously described (Wenkel et al, 2006) (Figure 4C and D). Quantification of FRET signals demonstrated that FRET occurred between YFP:CO and CFP:COP1 both in the nucleus and specifically in nuclear speckles (Figure 4C and D). In control experiments using YFP and CFP, YFP:CO and CFP or YFP and CFP:COP1 FRET was detected at significantly lower levels (Figure 4C). These experiments demonstrate that YFP:CO and CFP:COP1 colocalize and physically interact in the nuclei of plant cells.

The genetic and molecular experiments described earlier supported the hypothesis that COP1 negatively regulates CO activity at the post-transcriptional level. Therefore, we tested the effect of COP1 on CO protein levels. First, CO protein abundance was examined in nuclei of WT Columbia, co-10, transgenic 35S:CO and cop1–4 plants harvested 16 h after dawn under LDs, when CO protein is expected to be at highest abundance (Valverde et al, 2004) (Figure 5A). As shown previously, CO was clearly detectable in 35S:CO transgenic plants that overexpress the protein, but was below the level of detection in nuclei of WT plants. However, in cop1–4 mutants, CO was clearly detected, suggesting that in WT plants COP1 has a major function in reducing CO protein levels at this time. Strong support that the protein detected in cop1–4 mutants was indeed CO protein came from the analysis of cop1–4 co-10 double mutants, in which the protein detected in cop1–4 mutants was no longer present (Figure 5A).

First, CO protein abundance was examined in nuclei of WT Columbia, co-10, transgenic 35S:CO and cop1–4 plants harvested 16 h after dawn under LDs, when CO protein is expected to be at highest abundance (Valverde et al, 2004) (Figure 5A). As shown previously, CO was clearly detectable in 35S:CO transgenic plants that overexpress the protein, but was below the level of detection in nuclei of WT plants. However, in cop1–4 mutants, CO was clearly detected, suggesting that in WT plants COP1 has a major function in reducing CO protein levels at this time. Strong support that the protein detected in cop1–4 mutants was indeed CO protein came from the analysis of cop1–4 co-10 double mutants, in which the protein detected in cop1–4 mutants was no longer present (Figure 5A).

CO mRNA shows a diurnal rhythm in abundance in WT plants and in cop1–4 mutants, therefore the diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance was tested under LDs and SDs in cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5B and C). Under SDs of 8 h light, cop1–4 mutants flower dramatically earlier than WT plants (Figure 1) and CO protein was present for most but not all of the diurnal cycle (Figure 5C). CO was strongly detected soon after dawn, was absent or present at much lower abundance 4 and 8 h after dawn, and then was present strongly for the remainder of the night from 10 to 24 h after dawn.

In contrast, CO mRNA abundance fell between 14 and 24 h after dawn, whereas CO protein levels were high throughout this time. This comparison suggests that impairing COP1 function causes CO protein to be relatively stable in the dark. However, the steep decline in CO protein abundance between 0.5 and 4 h after dawn suggests that a second post-translational mechanism, independent of COP1, might negatively regulate CO protein levels in the morning.

This pattern was similar to that detected under SDs, but the protein was detectable for longer and was only absent at one time point, 6 h after dawn. The broader peak in CO protein under LDs is likely due to CO mRNA being expressed for longer under LDs, as previously described (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001; Imaizumi et al, 2003).

The photoreceptor phyB was previously shown to promote the degradation of CO protein early in the day in 35S:CO plants, and this was proposed to contribute to the inhibitory effect of phyB on flowering time (Valverde et al, 2004).

0019
To test whether phyB is responsible for the reduction in CO protein levels early in the day in cop1 mutants, the phyB-9 cop1–6 double mutant was tested for flowering time and CO protein levels. Under SDs, phyB-9 cop1–6 plants flowered at a very similar time to cop1–6 mutants, demonstrating that the early flowering of cop1–6 mutants is not enhanced by loss of function of phyB (Supplementary Figure 3). Under LDs, the double mutant flowered significantly later than either single mutant, which indicates a complexity in the interaction between COP1 and phyB under these conditions that cannot be simply explained by regulation of CO protein levels (see Discussion). To test whether phyB is responsible for the reduction in CO protein early in the day in cop1 mutants, protein was extracted from phyB-9 cop1–6 and cop1–6 plants 6 and 16 h after dawn under SDs. In the cop1–6 plants, CO protein was undetectable 6 h after dawn, as observed for cop1–4 mutants, but in phyB-9 cop1–6 plants CO protein accumulated strongly 6 h after dawn (Figure 5D). In contrast, CO mRNA was present at similar levels in cop1–6 and phyB-9 cop1–6 plants 6 h after dawn (Supplementary Figure 3). These results indicate that phyB is required for post-transcriptional regulation of CO expression early in the day and independently of COP1. However, in the samples harvested 16 h after dawn CO protein was present at similar levels in cop1–6 and phyB-9 cop1–6 plants, indicating that phyB does not influence CO protein levels at that time of day (Supplementary Figure 3).

Recently, CO protein was shown to be more abundant in spa1 spa3 spa4 triple mutants 16 h after dawn under LDs (Laubinger et al, 2006).

0019
The diurnal pattern of CO protein abundance in spa1–7 mutant plants was tested to compare with that described for cop1–4 mutants (Figure 5C and E). A similar pattern of CO protein accumulation was observed in spa1–7 and cop1–4 mutants between 14 h after dawn and the following morning, but the rise in the abundance of the protein was delayed in the spa1–7 mutant, so that it could not be detected until 14 h after dawn. In contrast, in the cop1–4 mutant CO protein was strongly detected 10 h after dawn. These results suggest a functional relationship between COP1 and SPA1 proteins in the degradation of CO, and that of the four SPA proteins SPA1 has the major role in regulating CO levels. The delayed increase in CO abundance in spa1–7 compared with cop1–4 mutants might be due to the activity of other SPA proteins.

Arabidopsis plants flower later under red light and previously this was proposed to be at least partly due to degradation of CO protein under these conditions (Valverde et al, 2004).

0019
To test whether red light-mediated degradation of CO protein is also impaired in the cop1–4 mutants, CO protein abundance was compared in 35S:CO and cop1–4 plants grown under white and red light (Figure 6). Similar levels of CO protein were detected in both lines grown under 16 h of white light (Figure 6). Furthermore, when both genotypes were exposed to 16 h of red light, CO protein abundance fell sharply in both 35S:CO plants and cop1–4 mutants (Figure 6). The reduced levels of CO protein observed in cop1–4 mutants under red light compared with white light are not due to lower levels of CO mRNA, which were identical under both conditions (Figure 6). This result demonstrates that a COP1-independent mechanism is required for CO protein degradation under red light.

We demonstrated that COP1 ubiquitin ligase is required to shape the diurnal pattern of CO protein accumulation as part of the flowering response of Arabidopsis to photoperiod. COP1 delays flowering of WT plants under SDs by preventing CO protein accumulation during the night and thereby ensuring that FT transcriptional activation does not occur. Under LDs WT plants flower early, but even under these conditions COP1 modulates CO protein levels, lowering the abundance of the protein towards the end of the day and during the night. These effects on CO are consistent with the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs and SDs, the largely day length-insensitive phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and suppression of these phenotypes to a large extent by co mutations. However, in cop1–4 mutants CO protein abundance is still reduced in the early morning and in red light, indicating that a second mechanism independent of COP1 regulates CO protein abundance under these conditions.

Under these conditions, cop1 mutants exhibit higher expression of FT and SOC1 mRNAs than WT plants. We showed that the early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under LDs or SDs largely depends on CO function and that in these mutants CO protein persists in the dark under SDs and LDs. These results suggest that post-translational regulation of CO is impaired in cop1–4 mutants.

Under LDs, CO protein levels are high in cop1–4 mutants throughout most of the day and rise earlier after dawn than under SDs, as shown for CO mRNA (Suarez-Lopez et al, 2001; Imaizumi et al, 2003). This effect on CO mRNA levels is at least in part due to FKF1- and GI-mediated degradation of the transcriptional repressor CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1), which is triggered by light, allowing CO mRNA abundance to rise earlier during the day under LDs (Imaizumi et al, 2005; Sawa et al, 2007). Perhaps surprisingly, our results indicate that under LDs, when CO promotes flowering of WT plants, COP1 also has a strong negative effect on CO protein levels. At the end of the day and during the night, CO protein accumulates to much higher levels in cop1–4 mutants than WT plants, although CO mRNA abundance is actually lower than in WT plants. These results indicate that under LDs COP1 has an unexplained role in increasing CO mRNA abundance, and a major function in lowering CO activity by reducing CO protein abundance.

The importance of this process in conferring a photoperiodic response is illustrated by the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under SDs, which is responsible for almost abolishing the response to photoperiod. COP1 therefore have an important function in turning over CO protein in the light and dark under these conditions.

COP1 activity is higher in the dark than light. One mechanism by which this light regulation occurs is through exclusion of COP1 from the nucleus in the light (Von Arnim and Deng, 1994), whereas in addition COP1 activity is repressed by direct interaction with activated cryptochromes (Wang et al, 2001; Yang et al, 2001). Our observation that CO protein levels are very high in the dark under LD or SD in cop1–4 mutants is consistent with COP1 activity being high in the dark under both day lengths and rapidly turning over CO protein. The increase in CO protein at the end of the day under LD indicates that even in the light COP1 contributes to keeping CO protein levels low. COP1 activity might only be reduced and not fully suppressed at the light intensities used in these experiments. If so, then higher light intensities might promote flowering at least partly by more effectively repressing COP1 activity and allowing CO protein levels to rise higher. This would suggest a role for COP1 and CO in the regulation of flowering by light intensity.

Degradation of CO protein in red light was proposed to involve the same phyB pathway that caused rapid turnover of the protein early in the day. We observed that in cop1–4 mutants the CO protein was still effectively degraded in red light and that there was a strong diurnal trough in CO protein levels early in the day. Degradation of CO early in the day was shown to require phyB but not COP1. The degradation of CO in red light likely occurs by the same phyB-dependent mechanism acting early in the day, as was shown by Valverde et al (2004), and this could be tested by comparing cop1–6 phyB-9 and cop1–6 plants under red light. Also, we cannot exclude that other phytochromes related to phyB may also have a function in CO regulation.

CO and FT are expressed in the vascular tissue and their expression in the phloem companion cells is sufficient to promote flowering (Takada and Goto, 2003; An et al, 2004). Furthermore, reducing FT expression specifically in the phloem companion cells delays flowering (Mathieu et al, 2007). Thus, the perception of photoperiod that is mediated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CO likely takes place in the companion cells.

0019
In WT plants, SUC2:COP1 also delayed flowering under LDs but not under SDs. The day length specificity of this effect suggests that the overexpression in companion cells affects flowering through CO, and indicates that COP1 levels are a limiting factor on CO degradation under these conditions.

Taken together, these results suggest that COP1 exerts an effect in companion cells to regulate FT expression.

This observation is consistent with our suggestion that COP1 exerts an effect to degrade CO at the end of the day and during the night, but not as part of the phyB pathway, which exerts an effect mainly in the morning or in red light. The temporal patterns of COP1 activity, therefore, support our understanding of the spatial pattern of activity of the pathways responsible for post-translational regulation of CO (Figure 7).

CO is composed of three domains, zinc-finger B-boxes, a central domain and the C-terminal CCT domain (Wenkel et al, 2006). CO and COP1 interact directly in vitro as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction was almost abolished when the C-terminal part of CO was removed, suggesting that COP1 interacts with the C-terminal region of CO, as was previously observed for interactions between COP1 and COL3 or between CO and SPA1 (Datta et al, 2006; Laubinger et al, 2006).

This interaction was almost abolished when the C-terminal part of CO was removed, suggesting that COP1 interacts with the C-terminal region of CO, as was previously observed for interactions between COP1 and COL3 or between CO and SPA1 (Datta et al, 2006; Laubinger et al, 2006). The interaction between COP1 and HY5 occurs through a defined domain that includes adjacent valine and proline residues that are essential for the interaction (Holm et al, 2001).

0055
The region of CO that interacts with COP1 contains three VP motifs, but changing all of these to AA did not impair the interaction with COP1 in vitro (data not shown).

0107
A similar result was previously observed for the interaction between CO and SPA1 (Laubinger et al, 2006). Therefore, the interaction between CO and COP1 likely involves a different motif than observed for the interactions between COP1 and COL3 or HY5.

Direct interaction between COP1 and CO was further supported by transient expression of COP1 and CO fused to fluorescent proteins in Arabidopsis leaf cells. The proteins colocalized in the nucleus and both occurred in speckles. Previously, COP1 was shown to colocalize with its target proteins HY5, HYH and LAF1 in nuclear speckles in onion epidermal cells (Osterlund et al, 2000; Holm et al, 2002; Seo et al, 2003).

COP1 speckles were proposed to represent nuclear sites for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (Al-Sady et al, 2006).

0019
The presence of CO and COP1 in nuclear speckles similar to those observed for other targets of COP1-mediated degradation supports the idea that direct interaction between COP1 and CO is required for CO degradation in the nucleus. This degradation presumably requires the SPA proteins, perhaps acting directly in a larger order complex with COP1, as SPA proteins also regulate CO abundance at least at the end of a LD and interact directly with COP1 (Laubinger et al, 2006). The mechanism by which CO is degraded by the SPA–COP1 complex has therefore strong parallels with that of HY5. However, the precise relationship between SPA1 and COP1 activity and whether the proteins exert an effect in a larger order complex that interacts directly with substrates is still not clear (Saijo et al, 2003; Seo et al, 2003; Hoecker, 2005).

CO activity is proposed to be restricted to LDs by an external coincidence model in which circadian clock control and light signalling combine to trigger CO activity (Searle and Coupland, 2004; Imaizumi and Kay, 2006). The cop1–4 mutant causes CO mRNA to accumulate earlier under SDs, so that cop1–4 mutations may in part accelerate flowering under SDs by causing CO mRNA to be expressed in the light, as previously shown for toc1-1 mutants (Yanovsky and Kay, 2002). However, the major time of expression of FT under SDs in cop1–4 is later during the night, suggesting that the earlier phase of CO expression in cop1–4 has a small part in the acceleration of flowering under these conditions. Rather the major role of COP1 in this system appears to be to degrade CO protein in the dark, and thereby ensure that no FT transcription occurs under SDs (Figure 7). The importance of this activity is demonstrated by the high abundance of CO protein in the cop1–4 mutant under SDs and the extreme early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under these conditions. During the final revision of this paper, another study described the role of cryptochrome signalling in suppressing COP1-mediated degradation of CO in the dark (Liu et al, 2008). Our data extend the model of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis by providing a molecular explanation for why CO mRNA expression during the night in SDs does not lead to FT transcription and promotion of flowering. The day length-insensitive early-flowering phenotype of cop1–4 mutants and the strong suppression of this phenotype caused by co null alleles demonstrate that degradation of CO under SDs is essential in conferring a photoperiodic flowering response.

For the in vitro expression of GAD:COP1, we produced the vector pJIC39 containing pT7:GAD:GATEWAY cassette and T7 terminator, so that by LR reaction with the COP1 entry clone, the construct expressing GAD∷COP1 is produced. Vector (Wenkel et al, 2006; Turck et al, 2007) pJIC26 is similar but contains only the GAD domain and was used for expressing full open reading frame of CO or parts of the ORF. COΔB-box and COΔCCT (Laubinger et al, 2006) were also tested for the binding with COP1.

Model for regulation of CO stability during photoperiodic flowering control in wild-type plants and cop1–4 mutants. Photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis involves two mechanisms of CO protein degradation: a phyB-dependent mechanism occurs early in the day or in response to red light and a second mechanism involving COP1 occurs late in the day and during the night. (top) In wild-type plants under LDs, CO accumulates in the evening due to an increase in CO mRNA and photoreceptor-mediated repression of COP1. CO can promote FT expression at this time and thereby flowering. During the night, COP1 is active and causes rapid degradation of CO protein by ubiquitination and activity of the proteasome. (second from top) Under SD, CO mRNA is expressed during the night and the protein is degraded through COP1 activity. CO protein does not accumulate and FT mRNA is absent, resulting in late flowering. (second from bottom) In cop1–4 mutants under LDs, CO is not degraded in the dark and accumulates to high levels. CO also accumulates to high levels at the end of the day, consistent with COP1 targeting CO for degradation at that time. However, CO protein still disappears early in the day, suggesting a COP1-independent mechanism of degradation at that time. (bottom) Under SDs in cop1–4 mutants, CO accumulates to a high level during the night and promotes FT expression at higher level than in wild-type plants. Enhanced CO activity at these times is responsible for the early flowering of cop1–4 mutants under SDs. In the morning, CO protein is degraded by a COP1-independent mechanism. The symbols represent CO protein abundance (red circles), COP1 (blue spheres), ubiquitin (small yellow circles on CO) and an unknown red light-activated degradation mechanism that is also active in the morning (dark orange spheres).

We identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX3X as an interaction partner of TBK1. TBK1 and DDX3X acted synergistically in their ability to stimulate the IFN promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated reduction of DDX3X expression led to an impairment of IFN production.

0019
Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that DDX3X is recruited to the IFN promoter upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism of action.

One component of the DNA recognition machinery is DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1), a protein that does not belong to either of the three major PRR families (Ishii et al, 2006, 2008; Takaoka et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2008).
0030
To identify novel interactors of TBK1, we generated stable RAW264.7 cell lines that express a GS-TAP-tagged version of TBK1 and purified the TBK1 protein complex by tandem affinity purification (Figure 1A and B) (Burckstummer et al, 2006). Mass spectrometry analysis identified TBK1 along with the core complex components TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator (TANK; 17 peptides), TBK-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1, also referred to as SINTBAD; 10 peptides) and TBKBP2 (also referred to as NAP1 or AZI2; 15 peptides), indicating that this native purification was efficient and in agreement with previously published data on the TBK1 core complex (Bouwmeester et al, 2004).

In addition, we identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX3X (RefSeq NP_034158) with five peptides. Immunoprecipitation experiments using tagged TBK1 suggested that its interaction with DDX3X and the transcription factor IRF3 are significantly weaker than the interaction between TBK1 and TANK and therefore not detected by coimmunoprecipitation under stringent conditions (Supplementary Figure 1A). Likewise, we could not detect any association of DDX3X with IRF3 (Supplementary Figure 1B).

We addressed the functional relevance of the TBK1/DDX3X interaction by reducing DDX3X expression and measuring the impact on type-I IFN production. siRNA transfection led to a decrease in DDX3X or TBK1 expression by at least 50% (Figure 2A and B).

The cells were infected with L.

Strikingly, we observed the same level of reduction for the cells in which DDX3X expression was reduced by siRNA, suggesting that DDX3X is necessary for IFN-β induction.

0081
In agreement with this, we did not observe any defect in the TNF-α induction neither when TBK1 nor when DDX3X expression was reduced by RNA interference (Figure 2C).

0411
To address whether DDX3X is also involved in this second loop of signalling initiated by IFNAR engagement, we decided to analyse the impact of reduced DDX3X expression on IRF7 transcription. We observed a diminished IRF7 induction upon TBK1 or DDX3X knockdown in cells infected with L. monocytogenes (Figure 2E) and this reduction was similar to the one observed for induced expression of the IFN-β gene (Figure 2C). By contrast, there was no effect of the TBK1 or DDX3X knockdown on the IFN-β-stimulated IRF7 expression (Figure 2E). Similar results were obtained for Mx2, another downstream target of the IFNAR (Figure 2E), indicating that DDX3X does not have a function in IFN-induced gene expression.

To test whether this function is affected by TBK1 activity, we used an established experimental set-up involving a Rev reporter plasmid (Yedavalli et al, 2004). This assay monitors the DDX3X-dependent nuclear export of a Rev response element-containing RNA encoding the CAT gene (Figure 3A).

MAVS and, to a lesser extent, TBK1 induced the IFN-β promoter, whereas DDX3X by itself did not (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, coexpression of TBK1 with DDX3X led to a synergistic promoter activation that was also observed for the ATPase-deficient mutant of DDX3X (Figure 4A), indicating that the ATPase and the helicase functions of DDX3X are dispensable for its synergy with TBK1. DDX3X did not synergize with TBK1 with regard to NF-κB promoter induction (Figure 4B), sustaining the specific role of DDX3X in the IFN pathway.

DDX3X did not synergize with TBK1 with regard to NF-κB promoter induction (Figure 4B), sustaining the specific role of DDX3X in the IFN pathway.
0081
When TBK1 was expressed at low levels (compare Supplementary Figure 2), TBK1 by itself was only a weak inducer of IFN-β. In contrast, DDX3X and TBK1 together gave a strong synergistic activation of the IFN-β promoter (Figure 4C). Importantly, this effect was also seen in TBK1−/− MEFs, but not in IRF3−/− MEFs, confirming that the DDX3X effect on IFN requires TBK1 and does not bypass the requirement for IRF3. Noteworthy, this synergy depends on kinase activity of TBK1 as inactive TBK1 S172A cannot synergize with DDX3X (Figure 4C).
0019
To address this question, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and amplified the enhanceosome-binding region of the IFN-β promoter by quantitative PCR (Figure 5A).

0004
GS-TAP-tagged DDX3X, isolated by affinity purification using rabbit IgG agarose, was also recruited to the enhanceosome region upon L.
0081
To address whether DDX3X recruitment to the IFN-β promoter depends on IRF3, we synthesized a biotinylated double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the IFN-β enhancer (Panne et al, 2007), along with two variants in which the IRF3-binding site was either mutated or deleted (Supplementary Figure 3A).

0676
We used these oligos as affinity reagents to monitor IRF3 or DDX3X engagement using lysates from untransfected RAW264.7 cells.

0676
Having established the importance of DDX3X in the TBK1-dependent IRF3 pathway, we further investigated the molecular nature of the relationship between TBK1 and DDX3X. Given the weak affinity of DDX3X for TBK1, we considered the possibility of a kinase–substrate interaction.

0081
We observed that coexpression of TBK1 with DDX3X is associated with a slight shift in DDX3X migration on an SDS–PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1). To investigate whether this shift in migration was dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, we generated different inactive mutants of TBK1, mutating either a putative phosphorylation site in the activation loop (S172A), the ATP-binding site (K38M) or the catalytic base (D135N). Activity of the TBK1 mutants was monitored by an in vitro kinase assay or by immunoblotting using an antibody that was raised against phosphoserine 172 in the activation loop of TBK1.

0276
We observed that coexpression of TBK1 with DDX3X is associated with a slight shift in DDX3X migration on an SDS–PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1).
0081
How does loss of TBK1 kinase activity affect DDX3X migration? The aforementioned shift in migration was strictly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, as it was not seen when different inactive mutants of TBK1 (TBK1 S172A, K38M or D135N) were coexpressed with DDX3X (Figure 6A). To unequivocally prove that the shift in migration reflects a phosphorylation event, we added the non-selective kinase inhibitor staurosporine and showed that the TBK1-induced shift was strongly diminished in the presence of the drug. Likewise, treatment of the cell extract with calf intestinal phosphatase led to a decreased shift in DDX3X migration, providing strong evidence that coexpression of TBK1 causes DDX3X phosphorylation. In parallel, we compared DDX3X to IRF3 in this assay (Figure 6A).
0081
To demonstrate whether the shift in DDX3X migration was specific for TBK1, we coexpressed DDX3X with a number of kinases including IKK-i, the closest relative of TBK1. Interestingly, IKK-i could also phosphorylate DDX3X, but DDX3X phosphorylation was not observed when the kinases IKKα, IRAK1, Abl or FAK2 were coexpressed (Figure 6B). This suggests that DDX3X is rather specifically phosphorylated by TBK1 and IKK-i.
0004
To rule out any indirect effect, we expressed His-tagged IRF3, DDX3X and Grb2 in Escherichia coli and purified them by HisTrap chromatography.

Equal amounts of purified proteins were then used for an in vitro kinase assay using TBK1 purified from HEK293 cells.

Equal amounts of purified proteins were then used for an in vitro kinase assay using TBK1 purified from HEK293 cells. Noteworthy, TBK1 alone (lane 1) or the substrates alone (lanes 2, 6 and 10) did not produce any signal.
0081
To test which of those putative phosphorylation sites are surface-exposed and therefore accessible to TBK1 in the context of the folded protein, we mapped them onto the structure of a truncated version of DDX3X that was recently published (Hogbom et al, 2007). All sites except T542/S543 mapped to the surface of DDX3X (Figure 7C), implying that the vast majority of these sites are bona fide TBK1 phosphorylation sites in vivo.

0081
We mutated either all potential phosphorylation sites collectively (Pan-M) or the phosphorylation sites in the DEAD domain (Dead-M) or those in the helicase domain separately (Helic-M) (Figure 8A).

0081
In contrast, phosphorylation of Pan-M was strongly diminished as was the case for the Dead-M mutant. The Helic-M mutant was also reduced in terms of TBK1 phosphorylation, but the effect was less pronounced. On the basis of these results, we conclude that both the DEAD domain and the helicase domain contain at least one TBK1 phosphorylation site and that the predominant phosphorylation event occurs in the DEAD domain. We tested these DDX3X mutants for their ability to synergize with TBK1 in the IFN-β reporter assay. Although DDX3X wt showed a strong synergy with TBK1, all the phosphosite mutants failed to enhance activity of the IFN-β promoter (Figure 8C). This establishes a causal link between TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of DDX3X and the ability of the two proteins to stimulate IFN-β expression.
0081
DDX3X is found to be a TBK1 substrate in vitro and in vivo and phosphorylation by TBK1 is necessary for DDX3X to stimulate the IFN-β promoter.
0081
Second, we developed a phospho-specific TBK1 antibody that can be used to monitor TBK1 activity in vivo (Figure 6). Third, we investigated the properties of TBK1 in vitro, using both recombinant proteins and peptides as substrates. On the basis of these analyses, we are providing what we believe may be the first consensus sequence for a TBK1 substrate, which could be helpful for the future identification of TBK1 target sites.
0402
Our data suggest that DDX3X is required for the function of the TBK1/IRF3 module and that DDX3X exerts at least part of this function at the promoter level. We would like to propose that activated TBK1 phosphorylates DDX3X which, in the nucleus, gets recruited to the IFN promoter where it stimulates transcription of the IFN-β gene.

0107
DDX3X has been reported to promote transcription by direct interaction with transcription factors (Chao et al, 2006). In our case, however, we fail to observe a direct interaction between IRF3 and DDX3X and the association of DDX3X with the IFN-β enhancer appeared to be independent of the IRF3-binding site.

0030
For instances, DDX3X has been reported to bind to the cap-binding protein complex (Shih et al, 2008).
0030
In apparent contradiction to this notion, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV-1 seem to exploit DDX3X and use it to their advantage (Yedavalli et al, 2004; Ariumi et al, 2007): DDX3X is needed to sustain the viral life cycle of HIV-1 by facilitating the nuclear export of HIV-1 RNA (Yedavalli et al, 2004). Likewise, DDX3X binds to the HCV core protein and supports viral replication (Ariumi et al, 2007). This obvious contradiction, however, may be resolved by interpreting it in light of the constant evolutionary struggle between host and pathogen: DDX3X may have evolved as an antiviral protein, but viruses then, in turn, developed strategies to hijack DDX3X function and use it for their own benefit, thereby counteracting the antiviral effect of DDX3X.

TBK1-mediated phosphorylation was assessed by incubating the three potential substrates (IRF3, DDX3X and Grb2) with TBK1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Lane 1 contains TBK1 without substrate, whereas lanes 2, 6 and 10 contain the substrates without TBK1 (left panel).

Phosphorylation-deficient DDX3X mutants fail to synergize with TBK1.

To counter the threat to the genome from DNA-damaging agents, cells use the DNA damage response (DDR): a set of events involving activation of DNA repair mechanisms and cell-cycle ‘checkpoint' signalling (Kastan & Bartek, 2004).
0030
A core IRIF component is the mediator of the DNA-damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1; Goldberg et al, 2003; Lou et al, 2003; Stewart et al, 2003; Stucki et al, 2005). MDC1 colocalizes with phospho-H2AX (γH2AX) owing to direct interactions between the C-terminal twin BRCT (BRCT2) domains of MDC1 and the γH2AX phospho-epitope (Stucki et al, 2005). MDC1 then mediates IRIF formation by other DDR factors such as p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), breast cancer protein 1 (BRCA1) and the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex (Goldberg et al, 2003; Stewart et al, 2003).

0081
We and others have recently shown that a cluster of repeated consensus ATM phosphorylation sites in MDC1 is crucial for the recruitment of BRCA1 and 53BP1 to IRIF, but not for NBS1 focus formation (Huen et al, 2007; Kolas et al, 2007; Mailand et al, 2007). On phosphorylation, these motifs are bound by the FHA domain of the ubiquitin E3 ligase ring-finger protein 8 (RNF8), which then generates ubiquitin conjugates at sites of DSBs that mediate BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment.

0423
Here, we show that a cluster of repeated motifs in MDC1, which are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2), are bound by MRN through phospho-dependent interactions with NBS1 that require its amino-terminal FHA and BRCT2 domains.
0081
A search of published databases for the post-translational modifications of MDC1 identified many phosphorylation sites; however, two studies (Beausoleil et al, 2004; Olsen et al, 2006) identified eight sites within a cluster of short-repeat sequences that shared the consensus motif Ser-Asp-Thr-Asp (SDTD) in which both the serine and threonine are phosphorylated.
0081
To investigate whether the SDTD motifs might interact with other DDR components, we generated a synthetic peptide that corresponded to MDC1 residues 325–340 bearing dual phosphorylation on Ser 329 and Thr 331. This peptide and its unphosphorylated equivalent were coupled to beads and used to retrieve interacting proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts.

0413
We noted that control binding assays with the γH2AX phospho-peptide retrieved MRN and MDC1 from nuclear extracts, whereas the phosphorylated SDTD peptide bound MRN only (Fig 1C).
0081
To study phosphorylation of the MDC1 SDTD region and to investigate its regulation, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to one of the MDC1 SDTD repeats phosphorylated on Ser 329 and Thr 331 (supplementary Fig S1A online). This detected MDC1 isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts, indicating that MDC1 S329/T331 phosphorylation is present in proliferating human cells (Fig 2A, left panels).
0004
Consistent with this, a bacterially expressed protein (glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SDTD2) encompassing two MDC1 SDTD motifs (contained within amino-acid residues 296–340 of MDC1) was efficiently phosphorylated by recombinant CK2 in vitro, as shown by a marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility and detection by anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum (Fig 2C, upper and lower panels, respectively).

0226
Consistent with this, a bacterially expressed protein (glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SDTD2) encompassing two MDC1 SDTD motifs (contained within amino-acid residues 296–340 of MDC1) was efficiently phosphorylated by recombinant CK2 in vitro, as shown by a marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility and detection by anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum (Fig 2C, upper and lower panels, respectively). By contrast, the equivalent protein bearing alanine substitutions of Thr 301 and Thr 331 (GST-SDAD2), while being phosphorylated by CK2 to some degree (presumably on CK2 consensus serine residues retained in the SDAD motifs present in this fusion protein), was detected only weakly with the anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum (Fig 2C).
0413
To investigate whether CK2 phosphorylation of the MDC1 SDTD region promotes MRN binding in vivo, we transiently expressed a haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MDC1 SDTD fragment coupled to a nuclear localization sequence in U20S cells (HA-SDTD6; supplementary Fig S1C online).
0004
To investigate whether these domains bind to the phosphorylated SDTD motif of MDC1, we expressed an N-terminal fragment of NBS1 containing these motifs (residues 1–343; HA-fNBS1) in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (despite many attempts using a wide range of expression constructs, we were unable to express soluble recombinant versions of the FHA or FHA/BRCT2 domains of NBS1 in bacteria).

0096
These proteins were then tested for binding to an MDC1 fragment encompassing the SDTD repeats (GST-SDTD6) that had or had not been treated with CK2 (Fig 3B). Significantly, the wild-type NBS1 fragment bound specifically to CK2-phosphorylated—but not unphosphorylated—GST-SDTD6, whereas this binding was abolished by mutation of the FHA or BRCT2 domain of NBS1 (Fig 3B).

0411
Furthermore, CK2-phosphorylated GST-SDTD2 retrieved NBS1 and RAD50 from both MRC5- and NBS1-complemented Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) cell extracts, but did not mediate such interactions when the FHA domain mutant of NBS1 was expressed in NBS cells (Fig 3C; see supplementary Fig S2 online for expression levels).
0426
To test this, we used siRNA to deplete endogenous MDC1 in U2OS cells stably expressing siRNA-resistant wild-type MDC1 (MDC1WT) or an MDC1 mutant without the SDTD region (MDC1SDTDΔ; Fig 4A; supplementary Fig S3A online).

0104
This residual interaction with MRN shown by the MDC1SDTDΔ mutant raises the possibility of other MDC1–MRN interactions, and would be consistent with previous findings (Goldberg et al, 2003); however, it is noteworthy that this weaker interaction was undetectable under higher salt conditions (supplementary Fig S3B online).
0426
To examine further the NBS1 recruitment defect of cells expressing MDC1SDTDΔ, we used the ‘laser scissors' technique to generate DNA DSBs along defined sub-micrometre tracks in live cells (Limoli & Ward, 1993). In MDC1WT-expressing cells, the extent of NBS1 recruitment closely resembled that of MDC1 (Fig 4Ea).
0081
Together with data obtained from proteomics screens (Beausoleil et al, 2004; Olsen et al, 2006), our findings indicate that CK2 phosphorylates several sites on MDC1, often at dual phosphorylation sites within the SDTD motif.

0081
For example, it was previously shown that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of the adaptor/mediator proteins XRCC1 and XRCC4 promotes the recruitment of polynucleotide kinase (PNK), Aprataxin, and Aprataxin- and PNK-like factor (APLF) to sites of chromosomal damage to facilitate the repair of DSBs and DNA single-strand breaks, respectively (Clements et al, 2004; Loizou et al, 2004; Iles et al, 2007). Interestingly, in these studies, CK2 was found to mediate factor recruitment through direct interactions between the CK2 phosphorylation sites on XRCC1/XRCC4 and the FHA domains of PNK, Aprataxin and APLF.
0096
This is consistent with a recent study showing 26S proteasome-dependent turnover of the mediator proteins topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), Claspin, 53BP1 and MDC1 following DNA damage (Zhang et al, 2006). Whether CK2 phosphorylation itself, or MRN binding to the phosphorylated SDTD motifs, protects a sub-pool of MDC1 from proteolytic degradation remains to be determined. It is also noteworthy that CK2 phosphorylations on XRCC1 mediate binding to PNK, Aprataxin and APLF (Clements et al, 2004; Loizou et al, 2004; Iles et al, 2007) and, conversely, that FHA domain-containing proteins such as PNK, Aprataxin and APLF are able to bind to CK2 phosphorylation sites on both XRCC1 and XRCC4. This raises the possibility that the phosphorylated SDTD regions of MDC1 might interact with proteins in addition to NBS1, and that the FHA/BRCT2 region of NBS1 might have more than one physiological target.

Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined by the presence of a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), play critical roles throughout the secretory pathway and in mitochondria, yet the machinery responsible for their proper membrane insertion remains poorly characterized. Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria.
0030
Such pathways have been the subject of intense investigations and include the signal recognition particle (SRP)/Sec61 translocon system that imports secretory pathway proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Egea et al., 2005; Rapoport et al., 1999; Wickner and Schekman, 2005) and the transport inner membrane/transport outer membrane (Tim/Tom) translocases that mediate insertion of transmembrane proteins into both mitochondrial membranes (Neupert, 1997; Pfanner and Meijer, 1997).

Within the secretory pathway, TA proteins play diverse roles, such as enabling vesicular traffic (e.g., many of the SNAREs, which mediate fusion of secretory vesicles, are TA proteins [Beilharz et al., 2003]), aiding in protein translocation, and promoting folding or degradation of membrane proteins (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001). Secretory pathway TA proteins are first inserted into the ER membrane, and are then sorted to their ultimate destination (Bulbarelli et al., 2002). In contrast, mitochondrial TA proteins are inserted directly into the mitochondrial membrane, where they facilitate mitochondrial fission, provide key components of the translocation machinery, and act in apoptosis (Borgese et al., 2007; Wattenberg and Lithgow, 2001). The membrane specificity of TA proteins is largely encoded in their TMDs and flanking regions (Egan et al., 1999). These signals, however, are not absolute, as some TA proteins, such as the mammalian oncoprotein Bcl2 (Krajewski et al., 1993; Lithgow et al., 1994), are found in both the mitochondria and the ER. Moreover, it is not well understood how targeting determinants in the TMDs are decoded by cellular machinery (Borgese et al., 2007).

Thus, TA proteins cannot exploit the classic cotranslational SRP/Sec61 translocation mechanism used by most secretory pathway proteins (Yabal et al., 2003). Early studies with cell extracts indicated that some TA proteins, such as CytB5, could integrate into membranes without the assistance of specialized machinery (Brambillasca et al., 2006; Rachubinski et al., 1980). However, most TA proteins, such as the mammalian Sec61β and synaptobrevin, have more hydrophobic TMDs, rendering them reliant on an incompletely characterized, ATP-dependent mechanism (Abell et al., 2007; High and Abell, 2004; Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008).

Based on a large-scale genetic interaction map of the secretory pathway, we previously suggested that three otherwise unassociated yeast proteins (Mdm39/Get1, Rmd7/Get2, and Arr4/Get3, the yeast homolog of Asna1/TRC40) cooperate to carry out a common function that strongly impacts on trafficking and, accordingly, named them Get1–3 (Golgi ER trafficking 1–3) (Schuldiner et al., 2005). In agreement with this idea, we and others have found that all three Get proteins physically associate (Auld et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2002; Schuldiner et al., 2005), and that loss of any of the GET genes leads to a pronounced Kar2 secretion phenotype, suggestive of a defect in retrograde Golgi to ER trafficking (Schuldiner et al., 2005).

Moreover, in the absence of Get1 and/or Get2, Get3 loses its ER localization, and is found both in the cytosol as well as in poorly characterized punctate structures (Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005).

This appears to be the primary role of Get1/2 complex, as, in the absence of Get3, there is no apparent additional cost to deleting Get1/2 (Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005) (Figure S4).

In the context of this model, the formation of aggregates and the exacerbated phenotype found in Δget1/Δget2 cells (Auld et al., 2006; Schuldiner et al., 2005) (Figure S4) would be explained by disruption of the Get3 cycle, leading to sequestration of potential substrates.

Y2H analysis, which reports on weak interactions occurring within the nucleus of assayed strains, is well suited for identifying Get3 binding proteins, as it can detect transient interactions that are independent of the presence of Get1 and Get2.

We visualized the subcellular localization of Sed5 with an N-terminal fusion protein with GFP (GFP-Sed5) (Weinberger et al., 2005). N-terminal GFP fusion was compatible with the correct targeting of Sed5 to the Golgi in control cells (Banfield et al., 1994; Weinberger et al., 2005) (Figure 2B). Deletion of Get3 led to a large pool of soluble protein and a corresponding decrease in Golgi-like puncta containing Sed5 (Figure 2B).

Consistent with this hypothesis, lowering protein levels of the essential Sed5 protein, by using a repressible tetO7 promoter (Mnaimneh et al., 2004), caused Kar2 secretion at levels that were similar to those observed in deletions of GET complex members (Figure 2E).

The role of the GET complex as a specific chaperone system for the TA protein Sed5 cannot explain the diversity of the phenotypes displayed by deletions of GET genes. The recent finding that the mammalian Get3 homolog Asna1 was involved in the insertion of in vitro synthesized Sec61β (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008) suggests that the GET complex has a broader role in TA protein biogenesis.

Although these data suggest that Get3 can specifically recognize a range of C-terminally located TMDs, it appears to have some selectivity, as we could not detect physical interactions for the mitochondrial TA protein Fis1 (Figure 3A), which, like other mitochondrial TA proteins, has a shorter, more hydrophilic TMD than secretory pathway TA proteins (Beilharz et al., 2003; Borgese et al., 2001, 2007).

As observed for Sed5, localization of these TA proteins was normal in control cells, but was altered in a Δget1/Δget2 background (Figure 3B).

In wild-type (WT) cells, this protein is thought to be first inserted into the ER, and then transported to the peroxisome via Pex19 (Elgersma et al., 1997; Hoepfner et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2005) (supported by data in Figure S7).

However, in Δget1/Δget2 cells, Pex15 initially formed cytosolic aggregates (Figure S8), but, after extended overexpression, began to appear in mitochondrial membranes (Figure 4B).

The diversity of TA protein functions suggests that the pleiotropic effects associated with loss of the GET complex might be a secondary consequence of TA protein mislocalization. To test this idea, we assembled a library of strains carrying mutant alleles for each of the predicted 55 yeast TA proteins (Beilharz et al., 2003) (including the six TA proteins localized to mitochondria), and plated these strains on various conditions for which we observed sensitivity in the get deletion strains. The library consisted of 43 deletion strains (Giaever et al., 2002) for nonessential TA proteins and 12 hypomorphic alleles of the essential ones.

This leads to a broad depletion of TA proteins, which in turn can account for the otherwise confusing array of phenotypes associated with loss of Get proteins. Binding to Get3 is also a decisive step in the insertion pathway, as in its absence, secretory pathway TA proteins may insert into mitochondrial membranes (Figure 7C).
0019
Second, for all secretory pathway TA proteins examined, the interaction with Get3 caused sequestration of the TA proteins into cellular aggregates in the absence of Get1 and Get2. This suggests that, when Get3 is present, most of the natural flux of TA proteins flows through the GET pathway.

0030
Thus the ability of cells to survive in the complete absence of the Get proteins may be analogous to the viability of yeast missing the SRP, which is made possible by the existence of alternate pathways for insertion of the numerous secreted and membrane-bound proteins that normally utilize this machinery (Ogg et al., 1992).

Possible alternate routes for TA protein biogenesis that have been suggested by in vitro studies include spontaneous insertion, which occurs efficiently for some TA proteins, such as CytB5 (Brambillasca et al., 2006). In addition, purified Hsc70/Hsp40 can promote the ATP-dependent (Abell et al., 2007) and SRP the GTP-dependent insertion of other TA proteins, such as Sec61β, (Abell et al., 2004).

0096
Such back-up systems, however, would lack the strong membrane specificity conferred by the ER localization of the Get1/2 complex, as well as the preferential binding of Get3 to TA proteins destined to the secretory pathway. The potential importance of such specificity is illustrated by the observation that some TA proteins, including Pex15 and Ubc6, mislocalize to the mitochondria when the GET system is impaired. This argues that, shortly after synthesis, Get3 competes with other factors (possibly Hsc70 and/or components that play an analogous role to Get3 in the targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins) for TMD binding, and that Get3 recognition commits the TA proteins to their subsequent insertion into ER membrane. It remains to be determined whether a dedicated protein machinery exists that ensures the accurate targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins, or whether the shorter, more hydrophilic nature of their TMDs prevents Get3 binding, thereby allowing for efficient, spontaneous insertion into the mitochondria.
0019
The interaction between Get3 and a TA protein substrate may thus represent a critical and potentially regulated decision step for establishing the destination target of TA proteins. Regulation could globally alter Get3 function or specifically affect the interaction between Get3 and target TA proteins.

In addition, Get3 is transcriptionally upregulated under both cytosolic (Auld et al., 2006) and ER (Travers et al., 2000) stress conditions. It has also been found that many TA proteins are palmitoylated (Roth et al., 2006) or phosphorylated (such as for Sed5 [Weinberger et al., 2005]) on residues that are immediately adjacent to the TMD.

Biochemical studies revealed that the mammalian Get3 homolog, Asna1/TRC40, binds the TA protein, Sec61β, and facilitates its posttranslational insertion into ER membranes (Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007; Favaloro et al., 2008). An in vivo role of Asna1 in TA biosynthesis in metazoans is suggested by the impaired capacity for insulin secretion in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants of asna1 (Kao et al., 2007).

Consistent with this, PSI-BLAST analysis identifies the WRB protein as an excellent and ubiquitously expressed candidate for a Get1 ortholog.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) was identified as interacting cellular protein with the abundant immediate early protein p30 from African swine fever virus (ASFV) in a macrophage cDNA library screening. The interacting regions of hnRNP-K with p30 were established within residues 35–197, which represent KH1 and KH2 domains responsible for RNA binding. Colocalization of hnRNP-K and p30 was observed mainly in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm of infected cells and infection modified hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and decreased the incorporation of 5-fluorouridine into nascent RNA. Since similar effects were observed in cells transiently expressing p30, this interaction provides new insights into p30 function and could represent a possible additional mechanism by which ASFV downregulates host cell mRNA translation.

ASFV open reading frame CP204L encodes a 30 kDa protein named p30 or p32 [3,4] which represents the most abundantly expressed viral protein early in infection.

0416
p30 exhibits a predominantly cytoplasmic location within infected cells and results phosphorylated in serine residues at the N-terminal [4] before its final incorporation to the viral particle. p30 is also one of the most antigenic ASFV proteins [5], eliciting virus neutralizing antibodies in infected animals [6–8]. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for p30 in first stages of infection, since antibodies against p30 are able to inhibit virus internalization into the host cell [6].
0416
Recently, a number of new hnRNP-K partners have been identified by using a proteomic approach [17] and new roles have been suggested for this protein. ASFV p30 was found to interact directly with host hnRNP-K during ASFV infection and we have mapped the interacting regions of both proteins. p30 modifies hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and could contribute to modulate hnRNP-K functions related to processing and export of mRNAs during ASFV infection.

GST-hnRNP-K and GST alone were purified from cleared lysates by mixing with glutathione-sepharose 4B beads (GE HealthCare), 5 ml of cleared lysate/400 μl of beads, for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, GST-hnRNP-K or GST beads were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, ph 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical)) at 4 °C for 1 h with insect cell extracts containing either p30 or p54 ASFV proteins overexpressed in a baculovirus system [8].
0416
Alternatively, monolayers of Vero cells infected with BA71V and lysed in 50 mM HEPES, ph 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitor, were similarly mixed with GST-hnRNP-K or GST beads.

Preconfluent monolayers of Vero cells were mock infected or infected with ASFV strain BA71V. Cells were washed and harvested from 0 to 24 hpi in cold PBS.
0019
The interaction was further confirmed by in vitro binding assays using a GST-hnRNP-K fusion protein bound to glutathione-sepharose 4B beads.

0416
Identical results were obtained in subsequent experiments using BA71V infected or mock-infected cells extracts instead of baculovirus infected cell extracts in the pull-down assay (Fig.
0416
In contrast, most hnRNP-K was detected also in other parts of the nucleus exhibiting no colocalization with p30, indicating a partial colocalization of hnRNP-K with p30. Interestingly, in the cytoplasmic region of those infected cells hnRNP-K was barely detected and colocalization percentages were not significant (data not shown).
0416
To confirm the retention of hnRNP-K in the nucleus of infected cells observed by immunofluorescence, the levels of hnRNP-K were assessed by Western blot at different times post infection using total, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein cell extracts. Total levels of hnRNP-K (Fig. 5A) were determined as infection proceeded (monitored by detection of p30) in order to discard that these changes could be to due changes in newly synthesized hnRNP-K or protein degradation. While no changes in total hnRNP-K levels were observed, quantitative analysis revealed a reduction of hnRNP-K levels in cytoplasm protein extracts from 12 hpi until the end of the infectious cycle (Fig.

0416
This reduction was in agreement with the observed increase of nuclear hnRNP-K levels, as judged by Western blot analysis. These results are consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis and indicate nuclear accumulation of hnRNP-K during ASFV infection.
0416
These changes in hnRNP-K distribution might disrupt the normal behaviour of this ribonucleoprotein which is involved in diverse biological processes including regulation of transcription and translation. To examine the transcriptional activity in ASFV infected cells we performed immunodetection of nascent RNA after FU pulse labelling (Fig.

0416
When compared with mock-infected cells, the incorporation of FU into nascent RNA was almost completely abolished in infected cells from 12 hpi, coincident with the time point at which hnRNP-K redistribution was observed.
0416
Infection of eukaryotic cells with large DNA viruses often results in extensive interactions of viral gene products with macromolecular pathways of the host cell. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified cellular hnRNP-K as an interacting protein with ASFV early protein p30. This interaction was further confirmed by an in vitro GST-fusion pull-down assay, using either p30 obtained from baculovirus system or ASFV infected cell extracts.

Core protein from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus (DEN), are proposed to relieve the repressive effect of hnRNP-K on transcription regulation of different human genes in vivo, disrupting the multiple functions of hnRNP-K and contributing to virus pathogenesis [11,12]. Studies with phosphoprotein IE63 (also named ICP27) from Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suggest that an IE63-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-K by casein kinase 2, results in inhibition of binding to RNA, affecting transport of cellular mRNAs and altering the subcellular location of hnRNP-K [13]. Nevertheless, no homology sequence in nucleotides or amino acids has been found when comparing these virus proteins interacting with hnRNP-K, including p30, indicating that this common interaction could occur in multiple and diverse ways.
0416
During ASFV infection, hnRNP-K normal function could be affected since changes related to hnRNP-K subcellular distribution are observed. First, accumulation of hnRNP-K within the nucleus of ASFV infected cells was evident and subsequently the levels of cytoplasmic hnRNP-K decreased while nuclear levels were increased, as infection proceeded, supporting the idea that accumulation of hnRNP-K within nucleus is most likely due to relocation from cytoplasm. Changes in hnRNP-K subcellular distribution have been reported previously in poliovirus infection where virus infection affects the normal nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of the host cell [29]. Second, this hnRNP-K accumulation is coincident with the appearance of granular structures in the nucleus where the ribonucleoprotein is detected.
0416
In this report we have demonstrated that small amounts of p30 are also present in the nucleus of the infected cell, so it can not be excluded that interaction with shuttling protein in cytoplasm could facilitate p30 traffic to the cell nucleus. Nevertheless, colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm during infection was not detectable by immunofluorescence, probably because of the low relative abundance of hnRNP-K in cytoplasm and its shuttling properties which difficult its visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy.
0416
In conclusion, protein p30 could have further regulatory actions associated to its specific binding to hnRNP-K protein in the nucleus of infected cells.

0416
Here, we confirmed that all changes observed in hnRNP-K distribution during ASFV infection take place simultaneously with an extraordinary reduction in 5-fluouridine (FU) incorporation into nascent RNA, which represents an alteration in the cellular transcriptional activity.

0416
However, in cell systems previously studied (macrophages and Vero cells), ASFV infection produces a general shut-off of protein synthesis that affects up to 65% of the cellular proteins [2,32,33]. This inhibition of protein synthesis is detectable very early after ASFV infection, so it will be interesting to determine whether the interaction here described is contributing to the general host cell shut-off or to a concrete cellular pathway.

Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) SIRT3 expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody.

0107
Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody subsequently showed a physical interaction between both wild-type and mutant SIRT3 with FOXO3a (Fig.

0054
To ensure that this interaction was not an artifact of the COS-7 cell line, or the transient transfection conditions, HCT116 cells, which contain undetectable levels of endogenous SIRT3 by western analysis, were stably transfected with p-myc-hSIRT3-wt, and p-myc-hSIRT3-mt SIRT3 expression vectors (Fig S2).

To ensure that this interaction was not an artifact of the COS-7 cell line, or the transient transfection conditions, HCT116 cells, which contain undetectable levels of endogenous SIRT3 by western analysis, were stably transfected with p-myc-hSIRT3-wt, and p-myc-hSIRT3-mt SIRT3 expression vectors (Fig S2).

0426
These cells were used to determine if the FOXO3a – SIRT3 interaction occurs in the mitochondria or the cytosol.
0402
To determine if FOXO3a activates promoter activity in our system, three FOXO3a expression vectors were employed that: (1) express the wild-type gene that is still inhibited by Akt (pCMV-FOXO3a-wt); (2) express a mutant gene that appears to be a dominant negative (pCMV-mt-FOXO3a); and (3) express a dominant positive (constitutively active) gene that cannot be phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt (pCMV-N-FOXO3a) 20. Co-transfection of these three plasmids with p3400-MnSOD-Luc, which contains the MnSOD promoter and its two consensus FOXO binding sites (supplemental Fig.
0411
A FOXO3a luciferase reporter construct was made that contains three FOXO3a binding sites fused to the luciferase gene (p3x-FOXO-tk-Luc) and this reporter vector was used to determine FOXO3a dependent gene expression as measured by luciferase levels. p3x-FOXO-tk-Luc was subsequently co-transfected into HCT116 cells with either pCMV-SIRT3-wt or pCMV-SIRT3-mt expression vectors. Expression of the wild-type SIRT3 increases luciferase activity (Fig.
0411
To determine if FOXO3a is downstream of SIRT3 in the activation of the p3x-FOXO-Luc the reporter plasmid was co-transfected with either the wild-type or mutant SIRT3 expression vector (as done in Fig.
0054
ChIP analysis showed that wt-SIRT3 cells have an increase in FOXO3a binding to upstream regulatory regions of gene promoters that each contain two canonical FOXO3a binding sites roughly 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (supplemental Fig.

HCT116 cells were used since they have nearly undetectable SIRT3 protein (data not shown). These results showed an increase in luciferase activity in cells overexpressing the wild-type SIRT3 gene, as compared to the mutant gene (Fig.

p3400-MnSOD-Luc was also co-transfected into HCT116 cells with either pCMV-SIRT3-wt or pCMV-SIRT3-mt SIRT3 expression vector.
0402
In this study, we suggest that FOXO3a is a mitochondrial protein and its function may be regulated by a physical interaction with SIRT3 in the mitochondria. This idea is based on the observations that: (1) FOXO3a is present in the mitochondria and physically interacts with SIRT3; (2) SIRT3 increases the DNA-binding of FOXO3a at two promoters resulting in an increase in gene expression; and (3) altered SIRT3 function results in altered and increased intracellular O2●-.

Cos-7 cells were transfected with either SIRT3 wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt) or deacetylation mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) vectors and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IPd) with an anti-Myc antibody followed by Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody.

The subcellular localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion. Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis.

Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis. Immuno-electron microscopy on Arabidopsis sections not only localized ACBP4 to the cytosol but also to the periphery of the nucleus upon closer examination, perhaps as a result of its interaction with AtEBP.

In Arabidopsis, six genes encode proteins that contain a conserved acyl-CoA-binding domain (Leung et al., 2004). They are the 10-kDa ACBP6 (Engeseth et al., 1996; Xiao et al., 2008), of which homologues are prevalent in eukaryotes, and larger ACBPs (ACBP1 to ACBP5), of which homologues have not been well-investigated in other organisms. Some of the larger ACBPs contain ankyrin repeats (ACBP1 and ACBP2), and kelch motifs (ACBP4 and ACBP5) that can potentially interact with protein partners (Li and Chye, 2003, 2004; Leung et al., 2004).

Our observations that various members of the Arabidopsis ACBP gene family consist of additional structural domains other than the conserved acyl-CoA-binding domain, plus their varying affinities for acyl-CoA esters, imply that they do not have redundant roles in plant lipid metabolism (Chye, 1998; Chye et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2004, 2006).

The acyl-CoA-binding domain in each ACBP has been shown to bind acyl-CoA esters, hence these ACBPs may mediate the subcellular transfer of acyl-CoA esters in plant lipid metabolism (Chye et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2004, 2006). Membrane-associated ACBP1 and ACBP2 could possibly maintain an acyl-CoA pool at the plasma membrane and participate in membrane biogenesis (Chye, 1998; Chye et al., 1999, 2000; Li and Chye, 2003; Xiao et al., 2008). We have also shown that transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ACBP1 showed enhanced tolerance to Pb(II)-induced stress, implying that ACBP1 could be involved in lipid bilayer membrane repair at the plasma membrane in response to Pb(II) stress (Xiao et al., 2008). ACBP3 has been demonstrated to be extracellularly-targeted (Leung et al., 2006) while ACBP4 and ACBP5 are predicted to be localized to the cytosol (Leung et al., 2004, 2006). The preference of ACBP4 and ACBP5 in oleoyl-CoA binding suggests that they could participate in the transfer of oleoyl-CoA esters to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the chloroplasts, in which de novo fatty acid biosynthesis occurs (Leung et al., 2004).

Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions.

0055
Subsequently, localization of ACBP4 and its interacting protein, AtEBP, was confirmed using transient expression of GFP- and DsRed-tagged fusion proteins in Nicotiana tabacum. When the spatial and temporal expression of ACBP4 and AtEBP was examined by Northern blot analyses, their similar induced expression by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments, and Botrytis cinerea implicate the feasibility of their potential roles in plant defence.

However, this was not investigated further in this study because it did not bind ACBP4 in subsequent co-immunoprecipitation, possibly due to the absence of some as yet unidentified essential cofactor(s) for binding in an in vitro co-immunoprecipitation reaction.

1Aa, the GAL4(DB)-ACBP4 fusion interacted with GAL4(TA)-AtEBP, as indicated by the blue colour arising from the production of significant levels of β-galactosidase. No interactions were observed in control yeast cells harbouring GAL4(DB)-ACBP4+GAL4(TA) (Fig.

Proteins, generated from plasmid derivatives of pBluescriptII KS using in vitro transcription/translation, were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE. An autoradiograph of the gel showed that the estimated molecular masses of the in vitro translation products of GAL4(TA)-ACBP4, AtEBP and ADF3, were 84 kDa, 28 kDa, and 16 kDa, respectively, according to their calculated molecular masses (Fig.

The interaction of AtEBP and ACBP4 was further substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation and by using autofluorescent protein fusions in the transient expression of tobacco leaf epidermal cells. ACBP4 and AtEBP showed overlapping expression patterns in leaves and stems and both were inducible by ACC, MeJA treatment, and infection with the fungal pathogen, Botrytis cinerea.

In this study, GFP:AtEBP was not confined to the nucleus but was also detected in the cytosol where it could interact with ACBP4. ACBP4:DsRed, transiently-expressed in tobacco leaves, was predominantly targeted to the cytosol but immuno-electron microscopy indicated localization of ACBP4 in the cytosol with signals detected at the periphery of the nucleus, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with AtEBP. Many protein factors, such as the photoreceptor phytochrome B, COP1, and some bZIP transcription factors demonstrate light-regulated movement between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Yamamoto and Deng, 1999).

Proteins of the ERF subfamily have been demonstrated to be mainly expressed in response to biological or physical stress, such as pathogen attack, ethylene or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, drought, and cold treatment (Zhang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005). Recently, Ogawa et al.

Furthermore, the function of AtEBP as a transcriptional activator may be related to ethylene signalling based on the analysis of gene expression levels in ethylene-related mutants (Ogawa et al., 2005).

Several ERF proteins have been reported to interact with other proteins including a transcriptional factor, a nitrilase-like protein, and an ubiquitin-conjugated enzyme (Büttner and Singh, 1997; Xu et al., 1998; Koyama et al., 2003). AtEBP was reported to interact in particular with an ocs element binding protein (Büttner and Singh, 1997) and ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004).

(2003) has reported that recombinant mouse ACBP in rat hepatoma cells and in transfected COS-7 cells interacts with the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), a nuclear binding protein that regulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.

HNF-4α also catalyses the hydrolysis of bound long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, and subsequently binds the fatty acid product, thus allowing cross-talk between acyl-CoA-binding sites and free fatty acid binding sites in HNF-4α (Hertz et al., 2005).

ACBP4 has been reported to bind oleoyl-CoA esters in vitro (Leung et al., 2004). Enzymes that use acyl-CoA esters but do not contain any acyl-CoA-binding domain could possibly dock to acyl-CoA-binding proteins, via protein–protein interactions at the ankyrin repeats of ACBP1 and ACBP2 or via such interactions at the kelch motifs of ACBP4 and ACBP5, to retrieve acyl-CoA substrates. If ACBP4 were a transporter and pool former of acyl-CoA esters, it would donate acyl-CoA esters to regulatory factors reminiscent of yeast ACBP in the gene regulation of OLE1, in which saturated fatty acids induce OLE1 transcription while unsaturated fatty acids repress its expression (Choi et al., 1996). In plants, fatty acid-derived signals have been implicated in the regulation of plant defence and development (Farmer et al., 1998). Calcium-independent phospholipase A2β, a multifunctional signalling enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of saturated fatty acyl-CoAs at physiologically relevant concentrations, is selectively autoacylated by oleoyl-CoA, is protected from autoacylation by Ca2+-activated calmodulin, and is rescued from calmodulin-mediated inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity by oleoyl-CoA (Jenkins et al., 2006).

While the precise roles for ACBP4 and AtEBP need to be addressed further, it appears that the roles of the new family of six Arabidopsis ACBPs (Leung et al., 2004) are not restricted to binding acyl-CoAs in various subcellular compartments in plant lipid metabolism, but may possibly be extended to the transfer of acyl-CoAs in relation to plant defence- and ethylene-related signalling.
