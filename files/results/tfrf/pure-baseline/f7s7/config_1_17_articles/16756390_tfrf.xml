Endogenously, RNA interference triggers are created from small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) in human cells can be programmed by exogenously introduced siRNA or endogenously expressed miRNA. siRNA-programmed RISC (siRISC) silences expression by cleaving a perfectly complementary target mRNA, whereas miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) inhibits translation by binding imperfectly matched sequences in the 3′ UTR of target mRNA. Both RISCs contain Argonaute2 (Ago2), which catalyzes target mRNA cleavage by siRISC and localizes to cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). Here, we show that RCK/p54, a DEAD box helicase, interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active siRISC or miRISC from human cells; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of P-bodies, and is a general repressor of translation. Disrupting P-bodies by depleting Lsm1 did not affect RCK/p54 interactions with argonaute proteins and its function in miRNA-mediated translation repression. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm but did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated RNA functions of RISC. Depleting RCK/p54 released general, miRNA-induced, and let-7-mediated translational repression. Therefore, we propose that translation repression is mediated by miRISC via RCK/p54 and its specificity is dictated by the miRNA sequence binding multiple copies of miRISC to complementary 3′ UTR sites in the target mRNA. These studies also suggest that translation suppression by miRISC does not require P-body structures, and location of miRISC to P-bodies is the consequence of translation repression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1966</offset><text>RCK/p54 plays a critical role in translational repression mediated by miRISC; translation repression by miRISC does not require P-body structures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2113</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2126</offset><text>Small non-coding RNAs play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes that code for diverse biological functions, e.g., in most metazoan organisms from nematodes to mammals [1–3]. Two classes of such small (∼ 21 nucleotide [nt]) RNAs that have been extensively studied in gene silencing are short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (reviewed in [4]). Currently, the best known mechanism of gene silencing is RNA interference (RNAi), an evolutionarily conserved process whereby double-stranded RNA induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA [5]. Long double-stranded RNA and precursors of miRNAs are processed by Dicer enzyme, and siRNAs are assembled into an RNA-induced silencing complex called RISC. The RNAi machinery can also be programmed in cells by introducing duplexes of siRNAs that are assembled into RNA-induced silencing complexes (siRISC) containing Dicer, argonautes, and other proteins [6]. Although RNAi has commonly been associated with siRNAs, this process is largely mediated in plants by miRNAs [7, 8], and examples of miRNA-mediated RNAi have been found in mammals and viruses (reviewed in [6]). Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs are important in human disease, including cancers [9–12]. For example, relatively low levels of let-7 miRNA up-regulate RAS protein in lung cancer cells, demonstrating a possible role of miRNA in tumorigenesis [13].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3619</offset><text>Both classes of small RNAs are assembled into silencing complexes that contain Dicer, argonautes, and other proteins [4], but they silence gene expression by two different pathways. Upon recognizing complementary mRNA, activated RISC forms an effector complex with the target mRNA [6]. Antisense siRNA in activated RISC serves as a guide for Argonaute2 (Ago2) [14–16] to catalyze the cleavage of target mRNA at a site ∼ 10 nt from the 5′ end of the siRNA [17]. Following cleavage, the target mRNA is degraded. Activated RISC, as a multi-turnover enzyme [18], is recycled to cleave additional mRNA targets.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4265</offset><text>In the case of miRNAs, they are assembled into miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) that contain Dicer, argonaute proteins, transactivation-responsive RNA-binding protein [19–22], and other cellular factors [4]. This assembly into miRISC has been implicated in miRNA functions [19–24].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4590</offset><text>Whether siRNA-mediated RNAi or miRNA-mediated inhibition of translation is triggered depends largely on the degree of complementarity between the siRNA or miRNA and its mRNA target (reviewed in [2, 25]). While both miRNAs and siRNAs must harbor sequences that recognize the target mRNA, miRNAs are generally not fully complementary to the mRNA target. In contrast, siRNA sequences must be completely complementary to the mRNA target cleavage site to efficiently induce cleavage through the RNAi pathway. Interestingly, miRNAs can behave like siRNAs and induce mRNA cleavage when the miRNA sequence is completely complementary to a target mRNA [18, 26, 27].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5273</offset><text>In human cells, the mechanism by which the endogenous miRNA and siRNA pathways are distinguished is not clearly understood. It is also unclear how miRNAs repress the translation of target mRNAs. New insights into miRNA function have recently been provided by localization of the RISC components, Ago1 and Ago2, in mRNA-processing bodies (P-bodies) [28–31], which are cytoplasmic foci containing translationally repressed mRNP complexes. During cellular translational control, an mRNP complex is formed containing the translationally repressed mRNA and associated repressor proteins and lacking translation initiation factors [32]. These translationally repressed mRNPs accumulate in P-bodies and contain proteins that mediate the translation [33–35], RNAi [28–31, 36], translation suppression [37], and decay [32, 38] of cellular mRNA. P-bodies, also referred to as GW or Dcp bodies, contain GW182 proteins that have recently been reported to play a role in RNAi [39–41]. Other proteins found in cytoplasmic P-bodies and implicated in mRNA processing are RCK/p54, Lsm1, Dcp1:2, and eIF4E [32, 33, 38]. Given that target mRNA and RISC components have been co-localized in P-bodies [29, 31], it is possible that P-bodies are the bona fide site for RISC-induced target cleavage or repression of translation. However, the mechanism by which target mRNA and miRISC are directed to P-bodies and how translation is repressed by miRISC is still unknown.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6816</offset><text>One P-body protein, RCK/p54, the human homolog of yeast Dhh1p, is a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD box helicase family and was originally identified as a proto-oncogene [42]. In human cells, RCK/p54 interacts in P-bodies with the translation initiation factor, eIF4E [33]. The Xenopus homolog of RCK/p54, Xp54, which interacts with eIF4E and forms RNA-dependent oligomers, represses the translation of mRNA in oocytes and eggs [43]. In yeast, Dhh1p interacts with the decapping and deadenylase complex and functions in translational repression [44]. Dhh1p has also recently been shown to stimulate translational repression by inhibiting production of the pre-initiation complex [45].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7536</offset><text>Here, we show that RCK/p54 interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active RISC assemblies from human cells programmed with siRNA or endogenous miRNA; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of cytoplasmic P-bodies, and acts as a general repressor of translation. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm. We further show that depletion of RCK/p54 did not significantly affect the RNAi function of RISC, but released general, miRNA-induced and let-7-mediated translational repression. Taken together, our results suggest that RCK/p54 is the effector molecule in miRISC that represses translation and that the specificity of this repression is dictated by the sequence of miRNA binding to complementary sites in the 3′ UTR of the target mRNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8391</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8399</offset><text>Human Argonaute Proteins Interact with RCK/p54, a Component of P-Bodies</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8471</offset><text>To investigate the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA translation and to determine the interactions of P-body components with the RNAi machinery, we constructed expression vectors for the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. These vectors were co-expressed in HeLa cells with Myc-tagged Ago2 and immunopurified using anti-Myc antibodies. The protein composition of isolated complexes was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Myc. When total cell extracts (TCE) were analyzed to determine the protein expression efficiencies of the vectors used in these experiments (Figure 1A, TCE lane), all YFP- and Myc-tagged proteins were expressed. Analysis of immunopurified complexes revealed that Ago1, Dcp2, RCK/p54, and eIF4E formed complexes with Ago2 (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane). Control experiments showed that YFP did not co-purify with Ago2 (Figure 1A). Interestingly, Lsm1 did not co-purify with Ago2, but localized to P-body structures in HeLa cells (Figure 1B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9572</offset><text>Since P-bodies contain RNA and proteins, many protein components of P-bodies are likely to be assembled on a common RNA scaffold without forming functional protein–protein interactions.

Analysis of immunopurified complexes showed that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Myc-Ago2 were not affected by RNase treatment, whereas the amounts of Dcp2 and eIF4E protein that co-purified with Myc-Ago2 decreased significantly (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane). Control experiments analyzing Myc-Ago2 showed that equal amounts of complexes were purified (Figure 1A, anti-Myc lane). Taken together, these results suggest that Ago1 and RCK/p54 directly interacted with Ago2, whereas Dcp2 and eIF4E interactions with Ago2 were RNA-mediated. These results do not rule out the possibility that Ago1 and RCK/p54 interactions with Ago2 were mediated by adapter protein(s).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10654</offset><text>Cytoplasmic P-bodies contain RCK/p54, Lsm1, Dcp2, and eIF4E [32, 33, 38]. To confirm whether these structures also contain Ago2 as recently reported [28, 31], we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors containing YFP-Ago1, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-Ago1, YFP-Ago2, and CFP-Ago2. Transiently expressed YFP- and CFP-tagged Ago1 and Ago2 co-localized at specific foci in cytoplasm (unpublished data). To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 1B, CFP-Ago2 co-localized with YFP-Lsm1 and YFP-RCK/p54, two bona fide P-body proteins [32, 33, 38]. In addition, immunofluorescence experiments showed that endogenous Ago2 co-localized with Lsm1 in P-bodies (Figure S1). Interestingly, over-expressing YFP-RCK/p54 increased the average number of P-bodies in every cell (Figure 1B, compare a and d). To confirm that the localization of Ago2 and Lsm1 to P-bodies was not the result of over-expression in transiently transfected cells, we immunostained cells with antibodies to endogenous Ago2 and Lsm1 and found that the localization of Ago2 and Lsm1 to P-bodies (Figure S1) was similar to that in Figure 1B. These results show that Ago2, Lsm1, and RCK/p54 are present in P-bodies.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="10728" length="216"/><text>To confirm whether these structures also contain Ago2 as recently reported [28, 31], we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors containing YFP-Ago1, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-Ago1, YFP-Ago2, and CFP-Ago2.</text></annotation><annotation id="1"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0663</infon><location offset="11064" length="208"/><text>To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy.</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="11064" length="208"/><text>To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy.</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="11064" length="208"/><text>To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12100</offset><text>To visualize protein–protein interactions in vivo, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a probe.

These two duplexes (unmodified siGFP and biotin-modified siGFP) were transfected into HeLa cells, and RISCs were captured by incubating cell extracts with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads [51, 52]. Beads and supernatants were analyzed for RISC function, i.e., the ability to cleave target mRNA in vitro [53]. RISCs primed with siGFP or biotin-modified siGFP guide strands efficiently cleaved their target mRNA (Figure 2B, lanes 1 and 3), but only biotin-containing RISC purified on streptavidin-magnetic beads showed cleavage activity (Figure 2B, lanes 2 and 4).

Interestingly, eIF4E did not co-purify with RISC, indicating that the Myc-Ago2 interaction with eIF4E that occurred in P-bodies (Figure 1A) was RNA-dependent, and eIF4E did not directly interact with Ago2 to assemble into active RISC by the guide strand.

RISCs containing miRNA were isolated from HeLa cells by affinity-capture as described in Figure 2A, with the following modifications. To specifically capture endogenous miRISC, 2′-O-methyl (2′-O Me) inhibitors of let-7 miRNA were employed [54,55]. HeLa cytoplasmic extracts expressing Myc-Ago1 and Flag-Ago2 were incubated with 3′-biotinylated-let-7–2′-O-Me inhibitor, which is complementary to the let-7 miRNA, and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. As a control, cell extracts were treated with the let-7–2′-O-Me inhibitor without 3′-biotinylation. After capture, beads containing miRISCs were washed with lysis buffer and split into two aliquots to determine miRISC function and protein composition. Function was determined by assaying for in vitro cleavage of a 32P-target mRNA that perfectly matched the let-7 sequence. The data in Figure 3B (lanes 1 and 4) show that cell extracts containing active let-7 miRISC cleaved the perfectly matched target mRNA with high efficiencies [54,55]. Incubation with let-7 inhibitors (with or without 3′-biotin) blocked the cleavage activity of let-7 miRISC in supernatant or beads (Figure 3B, lanes 2–3, and lanes 5–6). These results are consistent with previous reports [54,55] that adding 2′-O-Me oligonucleotides complementary to let-7 abolishes target cleavage activity by let-7 in cell extracts, indicating complete hybridization of the 2′-O-Me probe. Immunoblot analysis of affinity-purified miRISC using anti-Myc, anti-Flag, anti-RCK/p54, and anti-eIF4E antibodies (Figure 3C) showed that Myc-Ago1, Flag-Ago2, and RCK/p54 were associated with let-7 miRISC. As observed for the active RISC programmed with siRNA, eIF4E did not associate with miRISC.

To determine the status of P-body structures and RISC localization in cells after Lsm1 knockdown, Lsm1-depleted cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. We found that P-body structures were drastically disrupted, Ago2 was diffused throughout the cytoplasm, and Lsm1 and Ago2 were minimally co-localized (Figure 5B).

Isolation of miRNAs on polysomes also links the suppression of protein synthesis with arrest of translation initiation or elongation [29]. These studies also demonstrated that human Ago1 and Ago2 co-localize in P-bodies with other cellular proteins, such as Dcp1a, Dcp2, GW182, Lsm1, and Xrn1 [28–31]. A homolog of the P-body protein GW182 in Caenorhabditis elegans is the developmental timing regulator AIN-1, which also interacts with miRISCs and may target argonaute proteins to P-bodies [57]. To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E. Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent (Figure 1A). Ago1 and RCK/p54 immunoprecipitated with Ago2 after RNase A treatment of HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that these proteins directly interact with Ago2. Interestingly, RCK/p54, Ago1, and Ago2 were also identified as a component of active RISC programmed with siRNA or miRNA and purified by biotin affinity to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Figures 2 and 3). We examined the P-body localization of Ago2 with Lsm1 and RCK/p54 by co-expressing YFP-tagged Lsm1 and RCK/p54 with CFP-Ago2. Interestingly, overexpressing YFP-RCK/p54 in HeLa cells increased the number of P-bodies (from ∼ 8 to ∼ 20 foci/cell). The number of P-bodies containing CFP-Ago2 also increased (Figure 1B). These results suggested a functional relationship between RCK/p54-Ago interactions and their localization to P-bodies. To visualize protein–protein interactions in vivo, we used FRET as a probe. In cells expressing YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, the FRET efficiency was 21.07% ± 2.52% (Figure 1C and 1D). We also observed an efficient FRET between YFP-Ago1 and CFP-Ago2; however, FRET between RCK/p54 and Ago1 was moderate (6.41% ± 1.96%). Since FRET is quite sensitive to the orientation of the donor: acceptor pair, it is possible that CFP and YFP in Ago1 and RCK/p54 are not suitably positioned for efficient energy transfer.

To that end, we depleted RCK/p54 in HeLa cells and analyzed RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro (Figure 6). Depletion of RCK/p54 clearly disrupted the P-body structures and dispersed Ago2 localization throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 4). Surprisingly, depleting RCK/p54 did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Similar results showing the lack of P-body involvement in RNAi have been reported in Drosophila [39]. In that system, depletion of the P-body proteins, GW182 or Dcp1:Dcp2 decapping complex, showed that these proteins were required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing, but RNAi efficiency was not affected, suggesting that these two gene-silencing mechanisms were independent in Drosophila [39]. In addition, two recent studies reported that mammalian GW182 interacts with Ago2 and plays a role in miRNA function [40] and in siRNA-mediated RNAi [41]. Interestingly, depleting GW182 disrupted cytoplasmic foci and interfered with RNAi activity [41]. It is possible that GW182 is directly involved in human RISC function and does not spatially require P-bodies for its function. As an alternative approach to disrupting P-bodies, we treated HeLa cells with the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, which did not significantly affect RNAi activities in vivo and in vitro (unpublished data).

We chose RAS because it is an endogenous target of let-7, and 3′ UTRs of human RAS genes contain multiple complementary sites for let-7 to bind and regulate RAS expression levels [13]. Furthermore, let-7 inhibitors are known to enhance RAS protein expression in HeLa cells [13]. Depleting RCK/p54 in HeLa cells up-regulated RAS protein, and this increase in RAS levels was higher than that in general translation of control actin (Figure 7C), suggesting that multiple sites of let-7 miRISC binding to target 3′ UTR dictate the potency and specificity of translation suppression.</text><annotation id="31"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0411</infon><location offset="41352" length="578"/><text>We chose RAS because it is an endogenous target of let-7, and 3′ UTRs of human RAS genes contain multiple complementary sites for let-7 to bind and regulate RAS expression levels [13].

In human cells, RCK/p54 interacts in P-bodies with the translation initiation factor, eIF4E [33]. The Xenopus homolog of RCK/p54, Xp54, which interacts with eIF4E and forms RNA-dependent oligomers, represses the translation of mRNA in oocytes and eggs [43]. In yeast, Dhh1p interacts with the decapping and deadenylase complex and functions in translational repression [44]. Dhh1p has recently been shown to stimulate translational repression by inhibiting production of the pre-initiation complex [45]. Dhh1p and RCK/p54 also inhibit the mRNA translation driven by internal ribosomal entry sites in vitro, suggesting that this protein is a general translational repressor that may not require a cap structure for its function [45]. However, the in vivo function of Dhh1p required translational initiation [45]. Translation repression by miRISC and P-body localization require the 5′-cap structure in the target mRNA [29,58], which provides a unique and elegant control mechanism for translation and its regulation (reviewed in [59,60]). Recently, Petersen et al. reported an intriguing study showing that miRNA represses translation after initiation by a ribosome drop-off mechanism [61]. Therefore, it is possible that RCK/p54 interacts with miRISC and blocks translation elongation by binding to its multiple target sites with high affinity and creates a barrier for elongating ribosomes (see below).</text><annotation id="32"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0030</infon><location offset="43179" length="25"/><text>Recently, Petersen et al.</text></annotation><annotation id="33"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0889</infon><location offset="43179" length="25"/><text>Recently, Petersen et al.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43616</offset><text>We therefore propose that the function of RISC assemblies in cells can be described by a model with two independent pathways, depending on whether RNAi is programmed by the guide strand of siRNA or miRNA. In the first pathway, the RISC recognizes a perfectly matched target mRNA and functions as siRISC (Figure 8) by cleaving its target mRNA. This target mRNA cleavage activity and rapid turnover of siRISC induce the subsequent target mRNA degradation by exonucleases and does not require P-bodies. In the second pathway, the RISC recognizes the imperfectly matched target and functions as miRISC (Figure 8). Multiple copies of miRISC containing RCK/p54 could initiate an oligomerization event that sequesters the whole RNP and transports it to the P-bodies. This sequestration could also explain the cooperative effects of RISC function that enhance translation repression [56]. Once in P-bodies, translationally repressed mRNA could stay in oligomeric structures for storage or it could form a complex with decapping enzymes and cap binding proteins that would lead to the mRNA decay pathway. In other words, the miRNA in RISC could provide the sequence specificity and RCK/p54 could be the effector molecule that shuttles the target mRNA toward the fate of storage or processing in P-bodies. Since P-bodies are not a prerequisite for RCK/p54 to assemble into RISC or to function, it is possible that miRISC blocks protein synthesis by enhancing the ribosome drop-off during elongation of translation [61]. We propose that miRISC localization to P-bodies is the outcome of translation repression and not a prerequisite for miRISC function. Stored mRNA in P-bodies could reenter the active translation or mRNA decay pathway depending upon cellular conditions or stimuli that are presently unknown. How long mRNA translation can be repressed in the cytoplasm and which factors trigger mRNA transport to P-bodies are exciting areas for future research.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45593</offset><text>Our results on the interactions between RCK/p54 and the RNAi machinery suggest an intriguing role for miRNA function in development and carcinogenesis. However, most targets of miRNA have not yet been identified. A growing body of evidence suggests that miRNAs are important in human disease, including cancers [9–12]. For example, relatively low levels of let-7 miRNA up-regulate RAS protein in lung cancer cells, demonstrating a possible role of miRNA in tumorigenesis [13]. Two homologs of RCK/p54, Xp54 in Xenopus and Me31b in Drosophila, control the translation of maternal mRNA in oocytes [43,62,63]. Altered regulation of RCK/p54 expression levels has been implicated in the development of human colorectal tumors [64,65] and in hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis [66]. Overexpression of RCK/p54 and Dhh1p increases the number of Ago2-containing P-bodies (Figure 1B; [33,45]), suggesting that RCK/p54 is a critical factor in controlling cellular translation. Our results have identified RCK/p54 as an essential component of miRISC-mediated translation repression and provide a functional link between miRISC and P-bodies. In the context of spatially and temporally restricted miRNA expression, this system allows for exquisite regulation of protein expression by target mRNA. Therefore, perturbations of either miRNA or RCK/p54 expression levels can have deleterious consequences for the cell. What determines the balance between active translation and repression of mRNAs targeted by miRISC, and how cells control the specificity of this repression are key directions for future investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>47285</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>47307</offset><text>Expression vectors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47327</offset><text>Ago1 and Ago2 expression vectors with N-terminal YFP- or CFP-epitope tags were generated by PCR amplification of Ago1 and Ago2 coding sequences from pMyc-Ago1 and pMyc-Ago2 followed by cloning into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, California, United States).

Multiple numbers (n) of miRISC bind to target mRNA by forming a bulge sequence in the middle that is not suitable for RNA cleavage, accumulate in P-bodies, and repress translation by exploiting global translational suppressors such as RCK/p54. The translationally repressed mRNA is either stored in P-bodies or enters the mRNA decay pathway for destruction. Depending upon cellular conditions and stimuli, stored mRNA can either re-enter the translation or mRNA decay pathways.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>75408</offset><text>Author contributions.
