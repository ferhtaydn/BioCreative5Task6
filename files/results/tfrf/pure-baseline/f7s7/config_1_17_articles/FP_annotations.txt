A functional interaction between plant MEINOX-HD and BLH genes is substantiated by the synergism observed when pennywise a null-allele of BLH9 (18), allelic to bellringer, replumless, vaamana (19,22,23) is combined with the brevipedicellus1 (bp1) mutant (24).
0030
This dominant-negative function upon expression of the MEINOXSTM domain is strengthened in combination with the Drosophila engrailed repressor domain and best explained by squelching: the abundant MEINOXSTM domain depleting the native STM protein from essential interaction partners.
0226
As bait the sequences encoding the MEINOXSTM domain (amino acids 116–220 of the STM protein) or the slightly longer MEINOX-ELKSTM (amino acids 116–287) domain were cloned into the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) and expressed in fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain.

Verified cDNA inserts were either directly transferred into appropriate secondary vectors for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), co-immunoprecipitation or transgenic experiments and served as templates in second-round PCR-amplification to remove the stop codon or to adjust open reading frames (ORFs) for translational fusions.

For transient expression in leek epidermal cells, 50 µl of tungsten particles (1.1 µm diameter, BioRad) were mixed with 10–15 µg of plasmid DNA, 60 µl of 2.2 M CaCl2 and 20 µl of 0.1 M spermidine in a total volume of 150 µl.

Aliquots (10 µl) of DNA-coated tungsten were spotted on macro carriers and used to transform leek epidermal cells at 1100 psi rupture disc bursting pressure using a Biolistic PDS-1000-He apparatus (BioRad) The bombarded tissue was kept in Petri dishes on damp filter paper for 12–16 h in the dark and YFP or GFP fluorescence was visualized using a LEICA MZFLIII stereomicroscope.

Eluted protein samples were split (1/3 and 2/3), size-fractionated in parallel on two polyacrylamide SDS-gels (concentration adjusted to protein size), electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and subjected to antibody detection. HA-tagged (1/3 aliquot) partner proteins were identified using an anti-HA horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (clone 3F10; Roche 2012819). The co-precipitated 6× his-tagged STM protein was visualized by a primary penta-His mouse antibody [α-(H)5; Qiagen 34660] and secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-mouse IGG (Dianova 115-035-062).

Epidermal proteins after bombardement of leek epidermal cells were isolated in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton and size-fractionated by SDS–PAGE.

GFP fusion proteins were detected after transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP HRP-conjugated antibody (IgG1; Milteny Biotec 130-091-833).
0107
The method of choice to prove a physical interaction between candidate partner proteins in plant cells is BiFC (31,36).

0663
As a potential transcription factor, STM was expected to direct GFP fluorescence into the plant cell nucleus.
0663
Additional support for nuclear exclusion was obtained by several STM deletion constructs, none of which targeted GFP fluorescence to the plant cell nucleus (data not shown).
0226
Potential STM protein interaction partners were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with a meristem-enriched cDNA library (Materials and Methods) established in the vector pACT2 (prey) and the MEINOXSTM domain as a bait expressed from the pGDKT7 vector.
0018
Besides obvious controls in yeast such as retransformation of bait or prey plasmids and the combination with the empty bait vector, we included the MEINOXBp1 domain of the BP1 gene as bait as it encodes the closest relative to the MEINOXSTM domain in the Arabidopsis genome.

0019
In addition to the interactions in yeast, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope-tagged full-length proteins.

0019
The co-immunoprecipitation experiments therefore confirm that the full-length STM protein interacts with full-length ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9 proteins in vitro and substantiate the affinity of BLH/STM interactions.
0096
To verify STM interaction partners we constructed translational fusions between the N- or the C-terminal YFP sub-domains and the full-length STM protein or individual full-length BLH partner proteins.

0107
To verify STM interaction partners we constructed translational fusions between the N- or the C-terminal YFP sub-domains and the full-length STM protein or individual full-length BLH partner proteins. Optimal combinations of chimeric gene constructs are indicated in Figure 4 above each corresponding experiment.

0055
Any detectable fluorescence was dependent on the combination of the C-terminal with the N-terminal YFP sub-domain fused to STM or BLH partner proteins. In contrast, the fusion of the C- or the N-terminal YFP sub-domain to the STM protein and their co-bombardment in plant cells gave no fluorescence (data not shown).

However, without analysing the cellular localization of the STM protein, Bhatt et al.

0107
This may indicate a weak interaction between STM and BLH9 as suggested by the yeast two-hybrid results, that chimeric BLH9-NYFP protein levels remain low in leak epidermal cells, or that steric constraints interfere with a reconstitution of YFP fluorescence.
0809
According to our BiFC results, however, STM is targeted into the nucleus as a heterodimer with ATH1, BLH3 and BLH9.
0030
In Drosophila leg imaginal discs, the EXD protein is nuclear localized in proximal regions, which correspond to the expression domain of the HTH protein.

0107
The accepted scheme of nuclear import control of MEINOX TALE-HD proteins through interaction with the second class of TALE-HD proteins, BLH or PBC in plants and animals, respectively, suggests an ancient and conserved mechanism. In animals, the interaction between PBC and MEINOX proteins requires integrity of the bipartite PBC-A and B domains in the PBC and the MEINOX domain in MEIS proteins (13).
0096
Based on protein–protein interaction data, the animal PBC-A/B domain finds its counterpart in the BELL domain of plant BLH proteins although conservation at the amino acid level is weak.
0081
The PBC-B domain contains several conserved phosphorylation sites for Ser/Thr kinases and PBX1 sub-cellular localization correlates with the phosphorylation state of these residues whose dephosphorylation induces nuclear export (49).
0107
The evolutionary conservation of a functional interaction between members of two families of TALE-HD gene products, MEIS/PBX and KNOX/BLH proteins in animals or plants, respectively, suggests an ancient and possibly extant function.

Herpes simplex virus type-1 expresses a heterodimeric Fc receptor, gE-gI, on the surfaces of virions and infected cells that binds the Fc region of host immunoglobulin G and is implicated in the cell-to-cell spread of virus.

0114
Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) as the minimal Fc-binding domain and present a 1.78-Å CgE structure. A 5-Å gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the CH2-CH3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. The structure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus.

Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) has evolved several strategies to escape detection by the host's immune system, including the expression of an Fc receptor (FcR) called gE-gI that is found on the surface of virions and infected cells [1–3].

Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) has evolved several strategies to escape detection by the host's immune system, including the expression of an Fc receptor (FcR) called gE-gI that is found on the surface of virions and infected cells [1–3].

0416
Antibody bipolar bridging has been shown to protect the virus and infected cells from IgG-mediated immune responses, such as antibody- and complement-dependent neutralization [6], antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [5], and granulocyte attachment [8]. Experiments in HSV-1–infected mice comparing the effectiveness of human anti-HSV IgG versus nonimmune IgG or murine anti-HSV IgG (which does not bind gE-gI) have provided support for the importance of antibody bipolar bridging mediated by gE-gI [7].
0096
The gE-gI-binding site on IgG has been localized to the Fc CH2-CH3 interdomain hinge, a “hot spot” that serves as the binding site for several other mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins [19,20].

0107
Residues critical to the interaction were identified in binding studies comparing the affinities of human IgG subtypes for gE-gI, which found that gE-gI binds to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 with similar affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD] ˜40–400 nM), but does not bind several IgG3 allotypes or an IgG4 mutant in which His435 was changed to an arginine [21,22].
0107
In order to study the interaction between gE-gI and Fc in more detail, we initiated structural studies of gE, gE-gI, and a gE-gI/Fc complex.
0004
To determine whether isolated CgE (gE residues 213–390, where residue 1 is the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE and residue 420 is the first residue of the predicted transmembrane region) binds Fc and to measure the affinity of the interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance assay using two forms of recombinant Fc derived from human IgG1: wild-type Fc (wtFc) and nbFc, which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 linker that abrogate binding to gE-gI (Met252 to Gly, Ile253 to Gly, His310 to Glu, His433 to Glu, His435 to Glu, and Tyr436 to Ala) [12].

The Fc proteins were immobilized on the surface of a biosensor chip, and the binding of CgE was assayed at pH 8 and pH 6.

0104
Significant binding of CgE to nbFc was not observed under any conditions (unpublished data), but CgE binds wtFc with a KD of ˜7 μM at pH 8 (Figure 1A and1C).

0019
The relatively low affinity of the CgE/Fc interaction likely explains why a CgE/Fc binding interaction was not detectable by coimmunoprecipitation analyses [16].

0107
The affinity of CgE for Fc is similar to that determined for the interaction of gE with Fc at pH 8 (KD ˜30 μM), but ˜50-fold weaker than the affinity of the gE-gI/Fc interaction, which has KD values of 340 nM and 930 nM for the first and second binding sites on wtFc, respectively [12]. As previously observed for the interaction of gE-gI with Fc [12], the binding of CgE to Fc is much weaker at pH 6 than at pH 8 (Figure 1A and1B).
0114
The structure of CgE was determined to 1.78 Å by multiple anomalous dispersion using a crystal of selenomethionine (SeMet)–substituted CgE (Table S1).
0114
A 3-D search of the protein database using the DALI server [29] identified the coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor domain 1 (pdb entry 1eaj) and a mouse Fv (pdb entry 1mfa) as two of its closest structural neighbors, with root mean square deviations of 2.6 Å over 108 Cα atoms and 2.8 Å over 106 Cα atoms, respectively (Figure S1). The structural similarity between CgE and its structural homologs does not include the third β-sheet found in CgE.

0114
Further structural differences include the extension of strands C, C′, and C′′ as well as the A′–B and C′–C′′ loops, and the shortening of strands D and E as compared to a representative Ig V domain (Figure S1A), which leads to a more open organization of the first two β-sheets (sheets DEBB′A and A′GFCC′C′′).
0096
In the first step, a global search through possible rigid-body orientations of the CgE and Fc proteins was carried out with the constraint that the CgE/Fc interface contains at least one of the six residues in the consensus binding site on Fc (Met252, Ile253, Ser254, Asn434, His435, and Tyr436) [19].

0107
The magnitude of the energy gap between the correct models and other models is correlated with the binding affinity of the interaction [33]. Perhaps because of the relatively low binding affinity of the CgE/Fc interaction (Figure 1C), we did not observe a significant energy gap in this case, and hence could not confidently identify a single model as correct based on the global docking calculations alone.
0081
The identification of the CH2-CH3 linker region of the IgG Fc as the gE-gI binding site allows comparison with other proteins that share similar binding sites on Fc.

0096
The identification of the CH2-CH3 linker region of the IgG Fc as the gE-gI binding site allows comparison with other proteins that share similar binding sites on Fc.
0114
The complex structure shows that CgE interacts with Fc using regions of the first and second β-sheets, which correspond to the two β-sheets found in Ig V domains: strands A and B′ and the B′–C and D–E loops in the DEBB′A sheet and strands C, C′, and C′′ and the C′–C′′ loop in the A′GFCC′C′′ sheet (Figures 2C and4).
0096
Crystal structures are available for Fc complexed with four other proteins, domain B1 of protein A [25], domain C2 of protein G [28], rheumatoid factor [24], and FcRn [27], and with one peptide that bind to this region [19]. Each of the Fc-binding proteins is different in sequence and structure; however, their binding interactions with Fc are similar, sharing a set of six contact residues on Fc that have been referred to as the consensus region [19,27].

0096
Similar to the binding interfaces for the other five proteins that bind the CH2-CH3 linker region of Fc [19,20,27], the CgE/Fc interface is primarily nonpolar with a total of ˜1800 Å2 of buried surface area.
0416
Previous studies demonstrated a sharply pH-dependent interaction for HSV-1–infected cells binding to rabbit IgG [37] and for soluble gE-gI or gE monomers binding to human Fc [12], such that binding occurs at neutral or slightly basic pH but not at acidic pH.

0676
An analysis of the change in the affinity of the gE-gI/Fc complex versus pH suggested that two ionizable residues, likely histidines because they have a pKa near neutral pH, participate in the pH-dependent affinity transition [12].
0419
Although we cannot rule out local conformational variability that occurs as a function of pH, it seems unlikely that CgE undergoes large changes in conformation due to its relative compactness as a single domain, and arguments against pH-induced conformational changes in Fc have been made based on the similarity of Fc crystal structures at pH values between 4.1 and 8.0 [27].
0416
Insertion mutants in gE were also tested for their effects on viral spread in cultured epithelial cells and HSV-1 infected mice [7,17,18,38,39]. Although the mechanism of viral spread is unknown, it has been hypothesized that the extracellular domains of gE-gI bind to receptors at cell junctions, allowing entry into adjacent cells [17,40].
0114
The position of the C-terminus of CgE in the gE-gI/Fc complex structure, which is ˜30 amino acids before the predicted transmembrane domain, suggests that IgG bound by gE-gI is in an upright orientation with respect to the membrane (Figure 5), similar to FcαRI-bound IgA [41], but opposite to the orientation predicted for antibodies bound by other cellular Fc receptors such as FcγRIII and FcɛRI [42–44].
0114
Because we were able to solve the crystal structure of the CgE subunit of the gE-gI ectodomain at high resolution, the identification of CgE as a minimal Fc-binding domain (Figure 1) made its structure useful for interpreting the low-resolution gE-gI/Fc complex structure. An independent prediction of the complex structure using the coordinates of the unbound CgE and Fc molecules revealed a close agreement with the experimentally determined gE-gI/Fc structure (Figure 3C), demonstrating the power of new protein docking methods [33,34], and their potential for facilitating difficult crystallographic problems.
0114
As revealed in the low resolution crystal structure of a gE-gI/Fc complex, the CgE portion of gE-gI binds to Fc at the CH2-CH3 interdomain junction (Figure 3A), consistent with previous studies of the gE-gI/Fc interaction [12,21,23] and allowing a comparison of the Fc-binding properties of CgE with other proteins that bind to the same site on Fc [19,20,27].

0081
An analysis of the CgE/Fc interface predicts that the six residues that are the hallmark of the consensus binding site on Fc [19,27] are also central to Fc binding by CgE (Figure 4A).
0081
The crystallographic data can be used to deduce a model for how IgG binds gE-gI on the surface of virions or infected cells, whereby CgE binds the consensus Fc-binding site on each half of the Fc dimer, and gI and the NgE are located underneath the CgE domain between the CH3 domains of Fc and the membrane (Figure 5).

0081
The gE-gI binding site on Fc does not directly overlap with the binding sites for the FcγRs or the C1q component of complement, which bind on or near the CH2 domain [43,44,51], thus the structure of the gE-gI/Fc complex does not directly suggest how gE-gI binding to the Fc region of IgG leads to evasion of FcγR- and complement-mediated immune responses.

0007
However, an anti-HSV antibody that is bound to both gE-gI and an HSV antigen on the surface of an infected cell could be sterically hindered from also binding to host FcγRs or C1q due to the close proximity of the proteins in the antibody bipolar bridging complex.

0416
The demonstration that the gE-gI/Fc structure is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging (Figure 5) raises the possibility that anti-HSV IgG/HSV antigen complexes interacting with gE-gI on the surface of infected cells are endocytosed by gE-gI and degraded in the lysosomes after dissociation at acidic pH, resulting in destruction of antiviral antibodies and removal of viral antigens from the cell surface.
0081
The expression vector also encoded the gE hydrophobic leader peptide N-terminal to the inserted fragment and a C-terminal Factor Xa cleavage site and 6x-His tag.

Recombinant baculovirus stocks were generated by cationic liposome cotransfection of the expression plasmid with linear wild-type baculovirus DNA in High 5 insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) as described by the manufacturer.

0004
Bound protein was eluted in buffer containing 40 mM Tris (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole, and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) that was equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) and 150 mM NaCl.

0416
Briefly, insect cells that were infected with the CgE-recombinant virus were grown in Ex-Cell 400 media (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kansas, United States) for 16 hours, pelleted, and then resuspended in Sf-900 II SFM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 30 mg/l of L-cysteine (Sigma, St.
0104
KD values were determined by plotting the equilibrium response in the plateau region versus the logarithm of the CgE concentration for each injection and fitting the data to a single-site binding model. Although Fc contains two potential binding sites for CgE, the interaction was too weak to accurately fit the data to a two-site binding model.
0004
Various forms of gE and the gE-gI heterodimer were subcloned, expressed, and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cell supernatants by nickel affinity and/or IgG affinity and gel-filtration chromatography as described previously [12]. Two recombinant forms of the Fc fragment of IgG1, wtFc and heterodimeric Fc, which contain two and one gE-gI binding sites, respectively, were also produced in CHO cells and purified as described previously [12].
0096
In the next stage, a second constraint was imposed requiring that CgE make contact with both the CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc protein, as observed for other proteins binding to the Fc “hot spot,” [19] which resulted in pruning some of the top-ranking clusters.
0114
The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank accession numbers (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) are 2GIY for the CgE structure and 2GJ7 for the gE-gI/Fc complex structure.
0114
A half complex (one CgE and one chain of the Fc dimer) is shown with Fc in green, the CgE as positioned in the crystal structure in blue, and the CgE as positioned by the docking prediction in pink.
0096
Thus, C2 domains perform a variety of functions that often depend on their most common activity, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, but they are also believed to act as protein–protein interaction modules (reviewed in [21]). Although the mechanisms of Ca2+/phospholipid binding to C2 domains have been extensively characterized [22–24], no high-resolution structures of protein complexes involving C2 domains have been described.

0107
Hence, understanding the interaction between the Munc13–1 C2A domain and the α-RIM ZF domain at atomic detail can provide key insights into the functional diversification of C2 domains and ZF domains in general.
0104
Interestingly, the apparent molecular weights observed for isolated Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 in gel filtration were significantly higher than their monomeric molecular weights (Figure 1B and unpublished data), suggesting that they form stable dimers.
0104
We next used analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the oligomerization state of Munc13–13–209, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–132, and of a shorter fragment that we prepared during optimization for our crystallographic studies (Munc13–13–128; see below). Fitting the data to single ideal species yielded molecular weights of 49,100 Da, 35,200 Da, 30,100 Da, and 26,700 Da, respectively, which are approximately twice the predicted molecular weights of these fragments (24683.4 Da, 17821.3 Da, 16168.4 Da, and 14856.9 Da, respectively).
0114
Correspondingly, initial screens yielded no crystals for Munc13–13–150 and Munc13–13–209, and extensive screens with Munc13–13–132 only led to needle-like crystal clusters that were not suitable for structure determination (Figure S1).

0114
After condition optimization, we obtained high-quality crystals (Figure S1) that allowed us to solve the crystal structure of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer at 1.44 Å resolution using molecular replacement.Table 1 describes the structural statistics andFigure 2A shows a representative portion of the electron density.
0114
The Munc13–1 C2A domain monomer exhibits a β-sandwich structure formed by two four-stranded β-sheets that is characteristic of C2 domains (Figure 2B and2C), but the aforementioned β-hairpin formed by a long loop in monomer C (strands 8 and 9) has not been previously observed in other C2 domains. A structural comparison using DALI [26] showed that, among C2 domains deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb, the PLC-δ1 C2-domain shares the highest structural similarity with the Munc13–1 C2A domain (1.65 Å rms deviation for 106 equivalent Cα carbons).
0114
However, this β-hairpin is well packed against strand 6 of monomer C itself and appears to be an intrinsic feature of the Munc13–1 C2A domain, because the two Munc13–1 monomers present in the crystal structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2 heterodimer also contain this β-hairpin (see below).
0114
Hence, we designed two charge-reversal mutations, K32E and E63K, to disrupt Munc13–1 homodimerization based on the crystal structure of the C2A-domain homodimer.
0104
Gel filtration showed that both point mutations disrupt dimerization of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209, but preserve heterodimerization with RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4A and unpublished data).

0676
We attribute this increased apparent affinity compared to the wild-type complex to the lack of competition with homodimerization.
0104
Thus, the binding mode between monomer A and RIM2α82–142 observed in the crystals is consistent with all available data obtained in solution, whereas that involving monomer B is not.

The structure of the RIM2α ZF domain in the heterodimer with Munc13–13–150(K32E) (Figure 5E, blue) is similar to the solution structure of the isolated RIM2α ZF domain (Figure 5E, red) [20], exhibiting two zinc-binding sites and a central β-hairpin that is flanked on one side by N-terminal loops and on the other side by another β-hairpin and a short C-terminal α-helix (helix a2). Superposition of the two structures yielded an rms deviation of 1.9 Å for 54 Cα carbons, revealing that heterodimer formation induces significant conformational changes in the ZF domain that suggest a substantial malleability and that are consistent with the widespread changes in its1H-15N HSQC spectrum caused by Munc13–1 binding [20].
0107
As shown inFigure 6D, the interaction of the C-terminal α-helix of Munc13–13–150(K32E) with the crevice between the C-terminal β-hairpin and helix a2 of the ZF domain involves a combination of hydrophobic and polar interactions.
0114
Our Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 structure, together with the crystal structure of a rabphilin/Rab3A complex [27], and the sequence homology between rabphilin and RIM2α, also provide an explanation for our previous observations that Munc13–1, RIM2α, and Rab3A form a tripartite complex and that Munc13–1 alters the RIM2α/Rab3A binding mode [20].
0107
Disrupting the interaction between the N-terminal region of Munc13–1 and α-RIMs causes a severe impairment in priming [10,20] that is comparable to that observed in RIM1α knockout mice [16]. The marked decrease in Munc13–1 levels observed in these mice further supports the physiological importance of the Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction [14].
0114
The structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α ZF domain complex described here shows that Munc13–1 binding to the α-RIM/Rab3A complex should lead to a partial steric clash with Rab3A (Figure 7B), explaining our previous observation that the interaction of the α-RIM SGAWFY motif with Rab3A is released upon Munc13–1 binding [20]. The Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction still allows formation of the tripartite complex because helix a1 of α-RIMs is sufficient for Rab3A binding, but is expected to induce a significant reorientation of the N-terminal structural elements of α-RIMs (Figure 7C).
0081
It is worth noting that phosphorylation of RIM1α by PKA at an N-terminal site between the ZF and PDZ domains is key for mossy-fiber LTP [17], and that the surfaces of Munc13–1 involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization (Figures 2G,6D, and6E) contain several predicted phosphorylation sites (Y23, T25, and Y140). Hence, phosphorylation may be crucial for regulation of inter- and intramolecular interactions of Munc13–1 and α-RIMs during plasticity processes.
0096
In particular, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding is known to be a common activity of many C2 domains that is mediated by loops at one tip of the β-sandwich [21], but it is now clear that many C2 domains do not bind Ca2+ and likely act as protein–protein interaction modules.

In the past, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography were largely viewed as alternative methods for structure determination of biomolecules, but the usefulness of combining the strengths of both techniques is increasingly being recognized [32,33]. On the other hand, two structural genomics studies recently indicated that there is no overt correlation between1H-15N HSQC spectral quality and successful crystallization of protein targets [34,35]. However, it is unclear to what extent the fragment length of each target was optimized in these studies, and a separate structural genomics effort suggested that NMR spectra can be used to identify promising targets for structure determination by X-ray crystallography [36]. The data presented here, together with our previous NMR analysis of Munc13–1/α-RIM/Rab3 interactions [20], provide a particularly compelling illustration of how NMR spectroscopy can assist in X-ray diffraction studies of protein complexes that present particularly challenging problems for crystallization, and at the same time can provide complementary information.

Altogether, these observations suggest that combining the strengths of NMR spectroscopy in fragment optimization and analysis of protein–protein interactions in solution with the high accuracy of structure determination by X-ray crystallography for biomolecules of any size will be particularly useful to study complex protein networks.

Integrins, like several other proteins lacking the AP-2 localization signal are internalized from the cell membrane via nonclathrin-derived structures, and some integrins have been shown to subsequently fuse with compartments containing clathrin-derived cargo proteins (Ng et al., 1999; Naslavsky et al., 2003; Upla et al., 2004; Weigert et al., 2004).

Several members have been implicated to function on the endocytic pathway, in which the function of Rab5 is understood in more detail (Miaczynska and Zerial, 2002).

Although Rab proteins are known to bind a multiplicity of diverse effectors (Zerial and McBride, 2001), only a few examples demonstrate an interaction between a Rab GTPase and a cargo molecule (Seachrist et al., 2002; van IJzendoorn et al., 2002).

Finally, endogenous β1-integrins readily associated with endogenous Rab21 and to some extent Rab5 proteins in vivo. These associations were specific, as Rab7 and Rab11 failed to coprecipitate β1-integrin from these cells, even though separately all proteins were efficiently immunoprecipitated (Fig.

(A) Nontransfected MDA-MB-231 cells were surface labeled with cleavable biotin and lysed immediately or allowed to internalize cell surface proteins for 15 min.

We are aware that we have not excluded the effects of Rab21 expression for all types of unspecific internalization (e.g., macropinocytosis), but at least its closest homologues (Rab5 and Rab22) have not been shown to affect macropinocytosis (Rosenfeld et al., 2001; Kauppi et al., 2002).

Interestingly, the internalized receptor recycled rapidly back to the cell surface in Rab5- and Rab21-expressing cells with >50% of the labeled pool being recycled during a 15-min chase (detected by the reduction in the amount of biotinylated receptor in these cells where cell surface biotin is cleaved). Integrin internalization was reduced by expression of GFP-Rab21GDP, whereas GFP-Rab21GTP induced a steady accumulation of the internalized receptor when compared with GFP-, Rab5-, Rab11-, and Rab21GDP-expressing cells (Fig.

In density gradient fractionations, expression of GFP-Rab21 shifted the integrins toward the denser Rab-positive fractions (Hughes et al., 2002), and GFP-Rab21 cofractionated with α2-integrin in fractions 3–9 (Fig.

In the lighter fractions (3–5), GFP-Rab21 and integrin were found to cosediment with the Golgi-marker GM130, whereas in the denser fractions, cosedimentation was observed with the ER marker P115 (fractions 6–8) and EEA1 (fractions 7–9; Fig.

Combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; pseudocolored green) and conventional widefield epifluorescence analysis (pseudocolored red) showed GFP-Rab21 vesicles emanating from the membrane into the cell (changing from green to red/yellow) and back or vice versa (although formally this technique does not exclude the possibility that some vesicles will by chance come closer and further away from the plasma membrane).

We also addressed whether Rab21 expression alters the motility of integrins in live cells.

To investigate the importance of Rab21-mediated integrin traffic in β1-integrin–dependent cell adhesion, we studied MDA-MB-231 breast and PC3 prostate cancer cells having relatively high and low endogenous Rab21 expression, respectively (unpublished data). Of all the Rabs tested, overexpressed Rab21 was most efficient in increasing cell adhesion to collagen (86 ± 8% in PC3 cells and 22% in MDA-MB-231 cells; Fig.

0411
Rab21 expression did not enhance the initial adhesion step of cells plated on fibronectin or vitronectin (Fig.

6 C) and PC3 cells (not depicted), suggesting that efficient transport of endocytosed integrins to newly formed sites of adhesion, rather than a change in the steady-state expression of integrins on the cell surface, is the basis of Rab21-induced cell adhesion. Interestingly, GFP-Rab21GDP caused a modest increase in β1-integrin surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.

CHO cells lack endogenous collagen receptors. Transient expression of α2WT, α2AA (deficient Rab21 association), or α2A (unaltered Rab21 association), together with Rluc, enabled equivalent adhesion of these cells to collagen (Fig.

(C) Cell surface expression of β1-integrin was analyzed with dual-color FACS from transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 cells.

Conversely, stable Rab21-shRNA (short hairpin RNA)–transfected cells with reduced Rab21 expression (Fig. 3 C) migrated poorly, covering only sim;59% of the wound area, whereas Scr-shRNA–transfected control cells closed the wound almost completely (Fig.

0411
During this time, there were no obvious differences in the proliferation of the stable transfected cells (not depicted). These data suggest that expression of Rab21 regulates migration in these cells.
0411
Furthermore, Rab21 expression is shown to regulate integrin-containing focal adhesions and adhesion and migration of breast and prostate cancer cells. Live-cell imaging revealed that Rab21-positive vesicles move between the plasma membrane and the cell body and that expression of Rab21 modulates vesicular motility of integrins in vivo.
0107
The identification of integrin association with the putative early endosomal Rab21 led us to identify a functional relationship between integrin association with Rab21 and Rab5 and the regulation of cell adhesion.

Upon growth factor stimulus, internalized integrins either recycle very rapidly back to the plasma membrane from the perinuclear compartment (β1-integrins; Powelka et al., 2004) or are completely rerouted to a short-loop trafficking pathway directly back to the membrane (αvβ3-integrin; Roberts et al., 2004).

This is in agreement with the recent finding that integrins in newly forming protrusions travel on actin cables associated to motor protein Myosin X and that normal cell adhesion and spreading during the initial stages of adhesion seem to require the efficient motility of integrins close to the plasma membrane (Zhang et al., 2004).

Evidence from detailed biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Stefansson et al., 2004; Vinogradova et al., 2004) indicates that upon integrin activation the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails move out of the membrane into the cytoplasm, revealing the highly conserved residues to the cytoplasmic face and involving substantial structural changes in the cytoplasmic tails.

Integrins have been shown to internalize in a dynamin and PKCα-dependent manner after ligand binding (Ng et al., 1999). Internalized β1-integrins are then targeted to caveosomes (Upla et al., 2004) or transferrin-positive endosomes (Laukaitis et al., 2001) depending on the heterodimer, the cell type, and the stimulus used. Recent data showing that the caveolar and endosomal pathways intersect (Pelkmans et al., 2004) and our data showing caveolin-1–positive domains on Rab5- and Rab21-positive integrin–containing vesicles provide a possible explanation for these variable integrin trafficking routes.

To confirm whether these structures also contain Ago2 as recently reported [28, 31], we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors containing YFP-Ago1, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein)-Ago1, YFP-Ago2, and CFP-Ago2.

0411
To examine the contents of these cytoplasmic foci, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for YFP-Lsm1 and CFP-Ago2, or YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2, and visualized 24 h later by confocal microscopy.

0019
In cells expressing CFP-Ago2 and YFP-Lsm1, FRET efficiency was not significant (1.62% ± 1.11%), corroborating our immunoprecipitation results (Figure 1A).

0107
Similar to the YFP-RCK/p54 and CFP-Ago2 pair, YFP-Ago1 and CFP-Ago2 showed an efficient FRET (19.61% ± 4.51%), indicating a direct interaction between Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo [28].
0054
These results show that active RISC can be programmed in human cells by biotin-containing guide strands of siRNAs and can be captured on magnetic beads for further analysis.
0004
To probe the involvement of P-body proteins in this purified active RISC, its protein composition was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against Flag tag or endogenous Ago2, RCK/p54, eIF4E, and Lsm1.
0676
To determine the functional interactions of RCK/p54 with miRISC, we employed affinity purification of RISC and target mRNA cleavage capabilities of miRISC when the target has perfectly complementary sequences to the miRNAs.
0054
To understand the function and role of RCK/p54 in the RNAi pathway, RCK/p54 was depleted in P-bodies of HeLa cells by siRNA-mediated RNAi. 24 h after transfecting cells with siRNA, real-time quantitative PCR showed that mRNA levels decreased by more than 90% and immunoblot analysis showed that RCK/p54 protein levels decreased significantly without affecting the levels of other P-body proteins including Lsm1 and Ago2 (Figure S2). The effect of depleting RCK/p54 on localization of Ago2 was next examined by immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells expressing Myc-Ago2 and siRNAs against RCK/p54.
0411
HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against Lsm1, harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection, and TCEs were analyzed by immunoblot.
0411
P-bodies were disrupted in HeLa cells by transfecting them with siRNA against Lsm1, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection.

0019
After immunoprecipitation, RISC activities were analyzed by incubating the supernatant (S) or bead (B) phases with 182-nt 32P-cap-labeled let-7 substrate mRNAs having a perfectly complementary or mismatched sequence to the let-7 miRNA.
0226
To examine whether the P-body protein RCK/p54, also a component of RISC, is involved in siRNA-mediated gene silencing, the siRNA dose dependence of RNAi-mediated gene silencing was quantified in RCK/p54-depleted HeLa cells using a dual fluorescence reporter assay. Briefly, GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were constitutively expressed in cells transfected with reporter plasmids for enhanced GFP (EGFP) and RFP, respectively.

Briefly, GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were constitutively expressed in cells transfected with reporter plasmids for enhanced GFP (EGFP) and RFP, respectively.

0411
GFP expression was silenced by treating cells with a 21-nt siRNA targeting nt 238–258 of the EGFP mRNA.

0663
The fluorescence intensity ratio of target (GFP) to control (RFP) fluorophore was determined in the presence of siRNA duplexes and normalized to that observed in control-treated cells [52].
0411
When HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA mismatched for CDK9 (control), the second transfection with GFP siRNA silenced GFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., GFP/RFP ratios decreased with increasing concentrations of siRNA (Figure 6A, gray bars).
0411
To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether RCK/p54 was a general translation repressor in human cells. To this end, RCK/p54 expression was silenced in HeLa cells and general translational activity was analyzed by [35S]methionine incorporation (Figure 7A). The translational rates measured by [35S]-labeling were significantly greater in RCK/p54-depleted cells than in control siRNA-treated cells (Figure 7A), indicating that RCK/p54 was a translational repressor in human cells, consistent with results in yeast and reticulocyte extracts [45].
0007
HeLa cells were co-transfected with siRNAs directed against P-body proteins (RCK/p54, GW182, Lsm1, and Ago2) and with siRNA or miRNA reporters in the absence or presence of 25 nM CXCR4 siRNA.

0411
At 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and RL activities were analyzed. RL signals were normalized to Photinus pyralis luciferase (FL) signals from cells co-transfected with pGL3 plasmid as control.
0411
We next hypothesized that the expression of a specific cellular protein, known to be controlled by miRNAs, might be up-regulated in RCK/p54-depleted cells.

0411
When cells were treated with let-7 inhibitor, RAS protein levels increased, consistent with previous findings [13]. Strikingly, RAS protein expression in RCK/p54-depleted cells also showed a robust increase (Figure 7C) while RAS levels were not significantly affected when cells were treated with control siRNA or 2′-O-Me oligonucleotides. RAS mRNA levels did not differ drastically in HeLa cells after treatment with let-7 inhibitor, RCK/p54 silencing, or mock treatment (Figure S3).
0411
For control experiments, we treated cells with a CDK9 mm siRNA and a 2′ -O-Me oligonucleotide complementary to HIV-1 TAR RNA sequence [53]. Cells transfected with a control siRNA and let-7 inhibitor induced more firefly luciferase expression when reporter plasmids contained 3′ UTR sequences for NRAS and KRAS than for the control siRNA and a 2′-O-Me oligo control (Figure 7D), consistent with a recent report [13].
0107
Where in the cell does this physical interaction between RISC and RCK/p54 take place and does it require P-body structures? To address these questions, we disrupted P-bodies in cells by depleting Lsm1 and immunopurified endogenous miRISC, and analyzed its ability to cleave a target mRNA with perfect complementarity to let-7 miRNA (Figure 5).
0411
We chose RAS because it is an endogenous target of let-7, and 3′ UTRs of human RAS genes contain multiple complementary sites for let-7 to bind and regulate RAS expression levels [13]. Furthermore, let-7 inhibitors are known to enhance RAS protein expression in HeLa cells [13]. Depleting RCK/p54 in HeLa cells up-regulated RAS protein, and this increase in RAS levels was higher than that in general translation of control actin (Figure 7C), suggesting that multiple sites of let-7 miRISC binding to target 3′ UTR dictate the potency and specificity of translation suppression.

Once in P-bodies, translationally repressed mRNA could stay in oligomeric structures for storage or it could form a complex with decapping enzymes and cap binding proteins that would lead to the mRNA decay pathway.

Sorting of ephrin-B1–positive and –negative cells following X-inactivation has been observed in ephrin-B1+/− mice; however, the mechanisms by which mosaic ephrin-B1 expression leads to cell sorting and phenotypic defects remain unknown. Here we show that ephrin-B1+/− mice exhibit calvarial defects, a phenotype autonomous to neural crest cells that correlates with cell sorting.
0411
As a result of random X-inactivation, X-linked ephrin-B1 expression is mosaic in ephrin-B1+/− mice and ephrin-B1–positive and ephrin-B1–negative cells segregate from one another.
0411
Indeed, studies in zebrafish have shown that expression of Eph receptors and ephrins in animal cap cells was sufficient to block GJC at the boundary between both cell populations.
0226
We chose to focus on ephrin-B2 since loss of this gene has been shown previously to affect migration of a sub-population of cranial NCCs [19] and ephrin-B2 is expressed in the craniofacial area (Figure 2) We generated a mouse line harboring a null mutation in the ephrin-B2 gene by placing a cDNA coding for a fusion protein between histone 2B (H2B) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the ephrin-B2 promoter (A.
0411
It has been reported previously that patchy expression of ephrin-B1 in ephrin-B1+/− limb buds reflects sorting between ephrin-B1–positive and –negative cell populations that are generated in the ephrin-B1 heterozygous females via random X-inactivation and that this abnormal expression of ephrin-B1 in the limb bud correlates with a polydactyly phenotype that is observed in ephrin-B1+/− females [7,8]. Our data demonstrate that the calvarial phenotypes observed in ephrin-B1 heterozygous females correlate with an abnormal expression of ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in the presumptive frontal bone, likely due to cell sorting between ephrin-B1–positive and ephrin-B1–negative cells in the craniofacial mesenchyme.
0411
Using AP activity as a marker for osteogenic differentiation, we observed that cells isolated from ephrin-B1+/− embryos were consistently less prone to differentiate in vitro (Figure 3C), indicating that these defects are autonomous to the osteoprogenitor cells. In these primary cultures, expression of ephrin-B1 was detected in a punctate pattern in both AP-positive as well as AP-negative cells (Figure S3A), indicating that expression of ephrin-B1 and AP do not strictly correlate, and suggesting that ephrin-B1 does not regulate AP activity directly.

We found that interaction between ephrin-B1 and Eph-B2 resulted in inhibition of GJC in vitro (Figure 5).

These results demonstrate that interaction between EphB2 and ephrin-B1 impairs establishment of GJC.
0411
Expression of ephrin-B1 and Cx43 was partially overlapping in untreated NIH 3T3 cells, especially at interfaces between cells expressing ephrin-B1, which exhibited strong Cx43 staining (Figure 6Ba–c).

0004
We used a recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domain of Eph-B2 receptor fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG (EphB2-Fc) to pull down ephrin-B1.
0004
To identify the domain of ephrin-B1 required for the interaction with Cx43, we performed a pull down using a recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domain of ephrin-B1 fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG (ephrinB1-Fc).

0096
We generated a mutant form of ephrin-B1 that shows reduced binding to PDZ-containing proteins (ephrin-B1ΔPDZ [8]).

0081
Western-blot analysis of whole cell lysates indicated that both proteins were expressed, albeit at different levels, and that expression of ephrin-B1 did not influence the phosphorylation status of Cx43 (detected by differences in mobility on a SDS-PAGE), which is known to regulate GJC (Figure 7A).

0412
Cx43 could be detected in the pull downs from cells expressing either ephrin-B1 wild type or ephrin-B1ΔPDZ, however, the relative abundance of phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated band was changed.
0107
Because the lack of cell sorting in the experiments described above precluded the establishment of a functional link between the calvarial phenotype and the regulation of GJC in ephrin-B1 heterozygote embryos, we performed a genetic rescue experiment.
0030
Moreover, heterozygosity for the transcription factor Twist can lead to craniosynostosis, as well as to foramina, and both transcription factors regulate differentiation of frontal bone osteoprogenitors (Ishii et al., 2003).

0107
The genetic interaction suggests, however, that the discrepancy in coronal suture phenotype between ephrin-B1 heterozygous mice and humans could be due to genetic modifiers.
0096
Our data using chimeric embryos demonstrate that a mutation in the PDZ binding domain of ephrin-B1, which is known to phenocopy some of the phenotypes observed in ephrin-B1 null embryos including cleft palate [8], does not induce calvarial defects or polydactyly. These results indicate that the mutations found in CFNS patients might impinge on protein stability, protein localization, or binding of effector molecules independent of the PDZ domain.
0107
In our pull-down assay, wild-type ephrin-B1 interacted preferentially with phosphorylated Cx43 whereas ephrin-B1ΔPDZ interacted preferentially with unphosphorylated Cx43, suggesting that the interaction between ephrin-B1 and Cx43 might not be direct, and that these proteins might interact differently when at the cell surface or in the cytoplasm.
0411
To obtain ephrin-B1 null ES cells, one clone of targeted ES cells carrying the conditional allele of ephrin-B1 (ephrin-B1lox) was electroporated with a PGK-Cre expression vector.

For the experiment with mice carrying the CMV-Cx43 transgene, quantification of the foramen area between frontal bones was performed using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, California, United States) to record the number of pixels corresponding to the foramen. The mean values for females with (97,901 pixels) and without (117,391 pixels) the transgene were then normalized to the mean value obtained for males (91,824 pixels) (no significant difference was found between males with or without the transgene, n = 10).

Tissue sections were blocked in Blocking solution (PBS/5% horse serum) 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C in Cx43 antibody (1/100 in Blocking solution [Sigma]). Incubation with the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was for 1 h at room temperature (1/250 in Blocking solution).

At a developmental boundary and at ectopic ephrin boundaries in ephrin-B1+/− embryos, Eph/ephrin interaction leads to inhibition of GJC, possibly through endocytosis of Cx43, concomitant with a loss of stable cell–cell interactions between the two cell types. Sorting between these cells and inhibition of GJC concur to establish distinct developmental compartments.
0423
Also, biochemical analysis of purified Cdc23 (Mcm10) protein demonstrates that it is required for efficient phosphorylation of the Mcm2-7 complex by Dfp1-Hsk1 (Dbf4-Cdc7) kinase in vitro, and that Cdc23 (Mcm10) can directly interact with Dfp1-Hsk1 (Dbf4-Cdc7) [37].

The two-hybrid interaction between Snf1 and Snf4 is shown as a positive control (Figure 1A, row 4).

Therefore the genetic interaction observed between cdc23-M36 and Δabp1 appears to be Abp1-specific.

Phase contrast microscopy shows cells to be highly elongated 24–36 hrs following addition of 10 μg/μl thiamine (to repress transcription of the abp1+ gene) indicating that cell cycle progression is blocked. Cells also show other morphological defects including multi-septation and branching.

0054
We analyzed DNA content by flow cytometry to determine the precise arrest points for the different strains (Figure 3B). As expected, wildtype or mutant cells grown at the permissive temperature of 25°C display a 2C DNA content, indicating that most cells when growing exponentially are in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Yeast genetics has provided a powerful tool to identify some of the key proteins that are required for assembly of these complexes. One of these proteins, called Cdc23 (Mcm10), is conserved from yeast to man, and is required for the early events of DNA replication initiation.
0018
First, Abp1 not only interacts with Cdc23 (Mcm10) protein in the two-hybrid analysis, but deletion of Abp1 lowers the restrictive temperature for cdc23-M36, consistent with its proposed role in DNA replication.
0054
Our flow cytometry analysis suggests that cdc23+ (MCM10) is required for DNA replication initiation. Previous studies also indicate that following a shift to the restrictive temperature of 36°C, cdc23 temperature-sensitive mutant cells arrest in early-S phase [32].

The cdc23+ gene (bait) was cloned into pAS1 and co-transformed with pACT2 containing a S. pombe cDNA library (kindly provided by S. Elledge) into strain Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3,-112, URA3::GAL-lacZ, LYS2::GAL(UAS)-HIS3 cyhr2).

To arrest cells in G1, cdc10-129 and cdc10-129 Δabp1 cells were incubated at 36°C for four hours. Cells were then returned to the permissive temperature of 25°C, collected at the indicated times and fixed for flow cytometry analysis (FACS). To block cells in S phase, wt and Δabp1 cells were incubated in 15 mM HU for 4 hours at 32°C. Cells were then pelleted, washed 3× with YE media to remove traces of hydroxyurea, and resuspended in YE media. Cells were then collected at the indicated times and prepared for FACS analysis.

In murine thymocytes and tumour cells expressing an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, this DNA damage–induced cascade is blocked. Enforced intracellular alkalinisation mimics the effects of DNA damage in murine tumour cells and human B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, thereby causing Bcl-xL deamidation and increased apoptosis. Our results define a signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport, to intracellular alkalanisation to Bcl-xL deamidation, to apoptosis, representing the first example, to our knowledge, of how deamidation of internal asparagine residues can be regulated in a protein in vivo.

0411
Surprisingly, DNA damage–triggered deamidation in primary wild-type cells is mediated not enzymatically, but by intracellular alkalinisation caused by increased expression of the NHE-1 Na+/H+ exchanger (antiport), events blocked by expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase (OTK). In the case of either murine or human cancer cells, enforced alkalinisation triggers Bcl-xL deamidation, crippling its ability to provide protection from the pro-apoptotic consequences of DNA damage, thereby indicating possible novel approaches to cancer therapy.
0054
Because the BH3-only protein Puma, not Bim, plays a major role in DNA-damage triggered apoptosis [19,20], we also showed that both Puma and Bim are found in Bcl-xL immunoprecipitates from etoposide treated CD45−/−LckF505 thymocytes, whereas sequestration is ablated in wild-type cells, correlating with Bcl-xL deamidation (Figure 2B).

Interestingly, in the cells expressing these mutant forms of Bcl-xL, the apoptosis induced by enforced alkalinisation was reduced 4-fold compared to cells transduced with empty vector, or more than 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type protein (Figure 3G, right panel), which of course undergoes deamidation in response to alkali treatment.

Nevertheless, protection was not absolute, suggesting that Bcl-xL may not be the only mechanism protecting cells from apoptosis triggered by alkalinisation.

Taken overall, these results demonstrate that intracellular alkalinisation following DNA damage is both necessary and sufficient for nonenzymatic Bcl-xL deamidation, that the oncogenic suppression of Bcl-xL deamidation in pretumourigenic thymocytes is caused by inhibition of alkalinisation, and that versions of Bcl-xL competent for BH3-only protein sequestration are sufficient per se to protect cells from apoptosis at alkaline pHi.

Because the NHE-1 Na/H antiport is a well-established regulator of pHi [22] and has previously been implicated in the regulation of thymic apoptosis [23], we measured its expression in wild-type thymocytes after DNA damage and found that the NHE-1 level increased 2.5-fold within 5 h, whereas this increase was completely suppressed in pretumourigenic thymocytes (Figure 4B). No inhibition of increased NHE-1 expression in wild-type thymocytes was observed following addition of the Z-VAD-fmk caspase inhibitor (Figure S4A) nor following depletion of Bax and Bak from the cells (Figure S4B). We therefore carried out a further series of experiments to demonstrate that there was a direct causal linkage between the regulation of NHE-1 expression, pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. Given that the OTK blocks DNA-damage induced NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, this provides a powerful system for examining the consequences of experimentally enforcing NHE-1 expression in these cells by retroviral transduction. As Figure 4C illustrates (upper panel), an enforced 2-fold–3-fold increase in NHE-1 expression in pretumourigenic thymocytes, without DNA damage, restored Bcl-xL deamidation to a level comparable to that observed in a retrovirally transduced wild-type control in five separate experiments, thereby bypassing the OTK-mediated inhibition in deamidation.
0054
We measured apoptosis by two different methods to ensure that DNA damage–induced cell death following retroviral transduction was by apoptosis and not by necrosis. Figure 5C and Figure S6B illustrate that double staining for Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) followed by FACS analysis revealed a major increase in Annexin V+ PI− (apoptotic) cells following transduction with the negative control shRNA followed by either γ irradiation or treatment with etoposide, whereas there was no increase in apoptotic cells above baseline in the cells depleted of NHE-1: DNA damage–induced apoptosis was blocked 100%. Comparable results were obtained by measuring the sub-G1 peak by FACS (unpublished data) and NHE-1 depletion also correlated with increased survival (Figure S5B).

0081
For example, a number of serine kinases have been shown to regulate NHE-1 phosphorylation and activity [24,25], so we investigated the pSer and pThr levels in NHE-1 immunoprecipitates from irradiated wild-type and pretumourigenic thymocytes, but the basal level of phosphorylation did not change after DNA damage and was comparable between the two cell types (Figure S6C). Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that not all pSer/pThr sites were recognised by the cocktail of monocolonal antibodies (mAbs) used.
0054
Figure S7 shows that this was indeed the case: murine tumour cells resistant to genotoxic insult at physiological pHi values can be sensitised to die by enforced alkalinisation leading to Bcl-xL deamidation. Furthermore, a modest rise in pHi following incubation in a mildly alkaline buffer produces levels of Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis in murine tumour cells comparable to those observed by adding a DNA damaging reagent to wild-type thymocytes incubated at physiological pH.

We therefore determined whether genotoxic treatment in vitro of primary human B lineage CLL (B-CLL) cells might cause increased NHE-1, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis, as in primary murine thymocytes (Figures 3–5), or whether this might be inhibited, as with the murine cancer cells (Figure S7). In addition, we examined the consequences for these parameters of incubating cancer cells in alkaline pH buffers.

In addition, we examined the consequences for these parameters of incubating cancer cells in alkaline pH buffers. To perform these investigations, we divided each sample of patient cancer cells into nine aliquots that were either untreated, subjected to γ irradiation, or exposed to etoposide, followed by incubation at pH 7.2, pH 8.0, or pH 8.5 for 24 h. Each aliquot was then further subdivided into three samples to measure pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. As expected, exposure of cells to mildly alkaline buffers generated pHi values that displayed some variation between samples from different patients within a narrow range.

0426
Interestingly, unlike the murine tumour cells expressing an OTK, the B-CLL cells behaved somewhat more like wild-type thymocytes in that DNA damage at physiological pHe caused a mean increase of pHi of 0.22 units, an 8% increase in Bcl-xL deamidation, and an 18% increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Figure 6A and Figure S8A), compared to the higher thymocyte values of 0.45 pHi units, 40% increase, and 37% increase, respectively (Figure 3). The human cancer cell values for these parameters were greatly increased at alkaline pHe, generating tight correlations between increasing pHi, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (r values shown in Figure 6A).

This point is further illustrated by the gray shaded area shown in Figure 6A, which encompasses the overlap in sub-G1 (apoptosis) values that were obtained either by DNA damage at physiological pH or by enforced alkalinisation without DNA damage. Conversely, incubation of B-CLL cells at lower pH inhibited DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis (Figure 6B). Therefore with respect to enforced changes in pHi, the B-CLL cells behaved in a comparable way to both murine thymocytes and tumour cells.

These increases correlate with the observed increases in Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis in patients' cells (Figure 6A) and at the 2.6-fold level, at least, are comparable with the increases observed in wild-type thymocytes (Figure 4B). Furthermore, DNA damage–induced Bcl-xL deamidation in B-CLL cells was prevented by addition of either cycloheximide (CHX) (Figure S8C) or DMA (Figure S8D), establishing a possible linkage between DNA damage, NHE-1 function, and Bcl-xL deamidation in human cancer cells.

The structural importance of protein iso-Asp residues is likewise underlined by the expression of the putative repair enzyme L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase which converts iso-Asp to Asp residues: its deletion has striking effects on protein functions [28–30]. Furthermore, comparison of the crystal structures of native rat Bcl-xL with its deamidated version has revealed significant differences [10]; the structural implications of introducing iso-Asp residues into the disordered loop environment of Asn52/Asn66 merits further work.

The regulation of NHE-1 antiport function is complex, involving modulation of its expression, phosphorylation, and binding of regulatory proteins [24,25,31].
0054
The resistance to genotoxic attack by CD45−/−lckF505 murine tumour cells correlates, as in their pretumourigenic counterparts, with the inhibition of DNA damage–induced NHE-1 antiport expression, alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis (Figure S7), which is an apparent example of ”oncogene addiction”, whereby oncogene expression continues to be important for survival [36]. By contrast, DNA damage of human B-CLL cells, which should not express OTKs, triggered increased NHE-1 expression and apoptosis, achieving levels comparable with wild-type thymocytes (Figure 6C). However, enforced alkalinisation of either the murine (Figure S7) or human (Figure 6) cancer cells triggered significant increases in Bcl-xL deamidation and apoptosis, even in the absence of genotoxic attack (Figure 7C). In the case of the B-CLL cells, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the tight correlation observed between these events does not reflect causal efficacy, and further work will be necessary to elucidate this point.

For example, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL promoted the apoptosis of KARPAS-299 cells derived from a patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma [38], and down-regulation of Bcl-xL suppresses the tumourigenic potential of the causative NPM-ALK oncogenic fusion protein in vivo [39]. Knockdown of Bcl-xL also significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α)– and TNF-α - related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis by antitumour drugs [40].

The DNA was sequenced and the insert subcloned into pDEST17 (coding for a hexa-histidine tag) and transformed into Escherichia coli expression host DE3 (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Recombinant Bcl-xL (His-N terminal tagged) was expressed in E. coli and purified using Co2+ chelation beads so that rapid elution could be performed at pH 7.0 to prevent deamidation.

These digestion conditions were chosen after careful optimisation to give good and consistent yields of the peptides SDVEENRTEAPEGTESEMETPSAINGNPSW (peptide 1) and HLADSPAVNGATGHSSSL (peptide 2), containing the putative deamidation sites N52 and N66, respectively, but without inducing further deamidation.

0081
Peptides were eluted from the column (0.075 mm × 100 mm, Vydac C18) with a gradient of 5%–35% acetonitrile (containing 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 5.3) over 30 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. During the development phase of the methodology, the mass spectrometer was operated in MS/MS mode to conclusively identify the peptide digestion products and to confirm the sites of deamidation as N52 and N66. Once the identities of the peptides had been established, the mass spectrometer was operated in MS mode for subsequent analyses.

Intracellular pH was measured using a standard ratiometric method with a pH-sensitive fluorophore SNARF-1 by flow cytometry [44]. Briefly, cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were loaded with 10 μM SNARF-1 for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by washing and incubation in PBS at room temperature for 30 min prior to measurement of pHi.

For overexpression, NHE-1 or Bcl-xL (wild-type, N52A-N66A, and N52D-N66D) cDNA were amplified with AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and cloned into Xho1 and EcoR1 sites of the multiple cloning sites of the MigRI vector [45] upstream of an internal entry site followed by enhanced gree fluorescent protein (EGFP).

B-CLL donor peripheral blood was centrifuged through Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield PoC, Oslo, Norway), and the interphase peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were harvested for subsequent experiments. The purity of PBMCs was routinely checked by staining with antibodies CD3-Cy5, CD19-Fitc, and B220-PE and was analysed by flow cytometry.

(A) Wild-type thymocytes were pre-incubated with or without Z-VAD-fmk (200 μM), and were then cultured with or without etoposide for 24 h, harvested, and apoptosis was measured by measuring the sub-G1 peak by flow cytometry.

Even though these highly homologous receptors both activate the G protein stimulatory for adenylyl cyclase (Gs), signaling through β1AR and β2AR produces clearly distinguishable biological effects (Xiang and Kobilka, 2003; Xiao et al, 2004).
0006
To probe for a possible signaling complex including the β1AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged β1AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag.

0019
A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the β1AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (Figure 1A).

0019
Whereas ablation of PDE4A or PDE4B had no effect, inactivation of the PDE4D gene prevented co-IP of PDE activity with the β1AR (Figure 1B).
0081
All PDE4 long forms are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved PKA consensus site in UCR1 (see Figure 2D); this mechanism provides a ubiquitous negative-feedback loop critical for cAMP signaling (Conti et al, 2003).
0676
Conversely, PDE4D5 is the variant tethered to the β2AR/β-arrestin complex (Baillie et al, 2003) concurring with the preferential activation of PDE4D5 upon β2AR signaling (Figure 5B). In pull-down experiments using purified proteins (Figure 3D and E), β1AR efficiently interacts with PDE4D, whereas β2AR has negligible affinity for PDE4D, underscoring the direct mode of PDE4D–β1AR interaction versus the indirect, β-arrestin-dependent mode of PDE4D–β2AR interaction.
0096
The latter may include the competition of PDE4D with other proteins for binding to the receptor or, in an opposite fashion, PDE4D may act as a scaffold by tethering additional proteins to the receptor complex such as the exchange protein activated by cAMP or PKA-anchoring proteins (Dodge-Kafka et al, 2005).

0426
PAN-selective antibodies against PDE4A (AC55), PDE4B (K118), and PDE4D (M3S1), as well as splice variant-selective antibodies against PDE4D3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 (Richter et al, 2005), were used in IPs to determine the expression of the respective PDE4 subtype and splice variant in cardiac myocytes (Figure 2), as well as their PKA-dependent activation after β-adrenergic stimulation (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 2). A PKA-site-specific antibody from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) was used to measure PKA phosphorylation of the β1AR (Figure 6).
0411
All cells were cultured at 37°C and under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For expression of exogenous βARs and/or PDE4D constructs, cells were infected with adenoviruses 40 h before experimentation at an MOI of 2–6 (HEK293), 20–40 (cardiac myocytes), and 100 (MEFs), respectively.

As ‘mock' controls, cells were infected with comparable titers of an adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP).
0006
Flag-tagged receptors were then immunoprecipitated using M1-affinity resin (α-Flag antibody resin; Sigma Aldrich).
0004
Rat PDE4D3, expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus, was purified to >90% purity using an anti-PDE4D antibody (M3S1) covalently coupled to ProteinG Sepharose as described previously (Salanova et al, 1998). Flag-tagged β1AR and β2AR were also expressed in Sf9 cells and subsequently purified in a two-step procedure consisting of an initial affinity chromatography using M1-resin (immobilized anti-Flag antibody; Sigma Aldrich), followed by an alprenolol-sepharose affinity column. For βAR/PDE4D IP, equal amounts of purified β1AR and β2AR (1 μg) were coupled to M1 resin and then incubated in 500 μl of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 4 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% cholesterol hemisuccinate with 0.5 μg of purified PDE4D under continuous rotation for 4 h at 4°C.

AIRE is expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells, where it promotes the expression of tissue-restricted antigens.
0411
AIRE promotes the thymic expression of many tissue-restricted antigens, enabling the negative selection of developing T cells and thus precluding self-reactivity (Anderson et al, 2002; Liston et al, 2003); however, the mechanisms are so far unknown.
0019
Western blot analysis of H3/AIRE–PHD1 complex formation by using antibodies for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 indicated that H3K4 trimethylation hinders interaction (Fig 1F), whereas H3K9 trimethylation does not.
0081
The mapping of the H3/AIRE interaction site uniquely to AIRE–PHD1 was further confirmed by NMR titrations of histone H3 peptides into AIRE–PHD2, which bound neither methylated nor H3K4me0 peptides (data not shown).
0114
We generated a model of AIRE–PHD1 complexed with the H3K4me0 peptide on the basis of the crystal structure of the BPTF–PHD finger bound to H3K4me3 and performed molecular dynamics calculations for 10 ns.
0077
Remarkably, residues G305, G306 and G313 showed strong shifts when bound to H3K4me2 and disappeared completely from the NMR spectrum owing to line-shape broadening on binding to H3K4me3, indicating an involvement of this region in peptide binding.
0107
Although there are many similarities between these two structures and the AIRE–PHD1/H3K4me0 complex presented here, the AIRE–PHD1 finger differs in the additional recognition of the H3R2 side chain, which makes an important contribution to the high affinity of this interaction, as shown by our peptide mutagenesis experiments.

0411
We have shown previously that transiently transfected AIRE enhances target gene expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells (Pitkanen et al, 2005). So far, no cell line has been described with endogenous AIRE expression; therefore, we transfected HEK293 cells with an AIRE-encoding or control plasmid and generated stable cell lines called HEK-AIRE and HEK-control. We first tested HEK-AIRE compared with HEK-control cell lines for expression levels of tissue-restricted antigens that are downregulated in AIRE-deficient mouse thymic medullary epithelial cells (Derbinski et al, 2005). Indeed, the HEK-AIRE cell line showed enhanced expression of such antigens, including insulin, the principal autoantigen in type I diabetes (Babaya et al, 2005), involucrin and S100A8 (Fig 5A).

0019
Next, we studied in vivo histone binding by protein chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and observed that AIRE is found in complexes with a small fraction of histone H3 but not with H3K4me3.

0030
Although AIRE specificity towards chromatin might be influenced by other protein and DNA interactions (Ruan et al, 2007), the data presented here indicate that AIRE preferentially binds to and activates the promoters containing low levels of H3K4me3.

0411
On the basis of these results, we propose a speculative model for the regulation of tissue-restricted antigen expression in thymic epithelial cells (supplementary Fig S8 online). Normally, tissue-restricted antigens are silenced in immature thymic epithelial cells as they lack the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 on their promoters. During differentiation into mature thymic medullary epithelial cells, activation of AIRE expression (Kyewski & Klein, 2006) enables the read-out of non-methylated H3K4 as a signal to activate tissue-restricted antigen genes.

Compared to chemiluminescence, the detection with infrared dye is linear over a very wide range and amounts from 1 pg up to 10 ng can be detected more reliably (Chen et al, 2005).
0413
To test whether the increased Plx1 binding to chromatin was required for promoting DNA replication in the presence of stalled replication forks, we measured DNA replication in Plx1-depleted extracts treated with low amounts of aphidicolin.
0030
One of the truncated proteins contained the protein interaction domain known as the Polo box, which has been shown to interact with phosphorylated proteins (Elia et al, 2003).
0096
The fact that Plx1 binding to the Mcm complex is enhanced by checkpoint activation suggests that post-translational modifications of the Mcm proteins induced by the activation of the DNA damage response could increase Plx1 affinity for the Mcm complex.

The fact that Plx1 binding to the Mcm complex is enhanced by checkpoint activation suggests that post-translational modifications of the Mcm proteins induced by the activation of the DNA damage response could increase Plx1 affinity for the Mcm complex.

0081
Mcm2 is strongly phosphorylated on serine 92 by ATM/ATR (Yoo et al, 2004b), and its phosphorylation can be induced by pA/pT, aphidicolin or etoposide (Supplementary Figure 9A). To test whether phosphorylation of serine 92 of Mcm2 has a role in Plx1 recruitment to chromatin and in Plx1-mediated suppression of the checkpoint, we produced recombinant wild-type Mcm2 (Mcm2-WT) and Mcm2 in which serine 92 had been substituted with alanine (Mcm2-S92A) rendering it resistant to ATR-mediated phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 9B).
0107
As the interaction between Plx1 and the Mcm complex is mediated by the Polo box, which is a phospho-binding domain (Elia et al, 2003), it is plausible that direct phosphorylation of Mcm7 and/or Mcm2 by ATM/ATR could favour Plx1 interaction with the Mcm complex on chromatin. Indeed, we found that the interaction of Plx1 with Mcm proteins is increased by the induction of the checkpoint.
0030
Claspin inactivation by protein degradation restrains Chk1 activity and promotes recovery from the DNA replication checkpoint in mammalian organisms (Mailand et al, 2006; Peschiaroli et al, 2006). We have recently shown that Tipin, a factor critical for replication fork stabilization (Chou and Elledge, 2006), is required for Claspin binding to chromatin and for efficient Chk1 activation (Errico et al, 2007).
0411
Downregulation of Plk1 expression leads to cell death in transformed cells (Liu and Erikson, 2003a, 2003b), suggesting that Plk1 is required for the cell cycle of tumour cells. The genome of tumour cells is highly unstable and has many DNA lesions that would normally interfere with replication progression.

0107
With regard to the interaction between hTFIIE and hTFIIH, it has been shown that the C-terminal acidic region of hTFIIEα is necessary for native hTFIIH binding (Ohkuma et al, 1995) and hTFIIEα strongly binds to the p62 subunit of hTFIIH (Yamamoto et al, 2001; Okuda et al, 2004).

0030
hTFIIEα AC-D is found to share its binding surface on p62 PH-D with the acidic transactivation domains (TADs) of tumour supressor protein p53 (Di Lello et al, 2006) and herpes simplex virus protein VP16 (Di Lello et al, 2005).
0004
After purification by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography, all samples containing the C-terminal region, namely full-length GST–p621−548, GST–p62109−548, GST–p62238−548 and GST–p62333−548, were considerably degraded or incompletely translated (data not shown).

0096
Though such instability of the C-terminal half of p62 has previously been reported (Jawhari et al, 2004), we found that full-length GST–p621−548, GST–p621−108, GST–p621−238 and GST–p621−333 bound to hTFIIEα AC-D, whereas no binding was observed with GST–p62109−548, GST–p62238−548, GST–p62333−548 and GST alone (Figure 2B).
0077
To obtain the p62 PH-D-bound structure of hTFIIEα AC-D using NMR, we performed NMR titration experiments in buffers both with and without 100 mM NaCl for both domains (Supplementary Figures 1–3). Although in the 100 mM NaCl buffer the dissociation constant (Kd) between AC-D and p62 PH-D was estimated from the titration plots as 376±81 nM (Supplementary Figure 1C) or 237±82 nM (Supplementary Figure 2C), the NaCl-free buffer NMR titration experiment showed much stronger binding affinity between AC-D and p62 PH-D because of the slow exchange timescale with a Kd below about 150 nM (Supplementary Figure 3).

0107
Although in the 100 mM NaCl buffer the dissociation constant (Kd) between AC-D and p62 PH-D was estimated from the titration plots as 376±81 nM (Supplementary Figure 1C) or 237±82 nM (Supplementary Figure 2C), the NaCl-free buffer NMR titration experiment showed much stronger binding affinity between AC-D and p62 PH-D because of the slow exchange timescale with a Kd below about 150 nM (Supplementary Figure 3).

0077
These interacting amino acids were also observed in the NMR titration experiments. In hTFIIEα AC-D, the NMR signals of E386, F387, E388, E389, V390, A391 and D392 were changed significantly upon addition of p62 PH-D (Supplementary Figure 1B) and also in p62 PH-D the NMR signals of K19, Q53, K54, I55, S56, E58, K60, A61, I63, Q64, L65, Q66, T74, T75 and F77 were changed by adding hTFIIEα AC-D (Supplementary Figure 2B).
0004
These mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli with hexa-histidine (6H) at the N terminus.

0676
All were soluble and could therefore be easily purified using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose column (Figure 4A).
0276
The mixture was analysed by SDS–PAGE and phosphorylated Rpb1 from Pol II was detected by autoradiography (Figure 4D).
0030
Furthermore, the herpes simplex virus protein 16 (VP16) TAD also interacts with virtually identical sites of Tfb1 and p62 PH-D (Di Lello et al, 2005).

0081
Interestingly, the binding sites of p62 for p53 TAD2 and VP16 TAD significantly overlap with a part of the binding site for hTFIIEα AC-D.

0081
The binding site of p53 TAD2 peptide is disordered in an unbound state, but it forms a nine-residue amphipathic α-helix upon binding to Tfb1 PH-D and p62 PH-D.
0096
As shown, K54, which forms the shallow pocket for F387 of hTFIIEα AC-D with its side chain interacting electrostatically with E389 of hTFIIEα AC-D, was the residue for which mutation to alanine had the largest effect as it prevented binding of all three hTFIIEα proteins tested (Figure 5C, lane 5). In addition, Q66, which also forms the same shallow pocket for F387 of hTFIIEα AC-D and the side chain of Q66 makes contact with F387 through amino-aromatic interaction, was shown to be essential for binding to hTFIIEα AC-D (Figure 5C, lane 6).
0107
In the present study, the specific interaction between hTFIIEα AC-D and hTFIIH p62 PH-D was explored, and structures of both the free and PH-D-bound forms of hTFIIEα AC-D were determined. This is the first report of the structural determination of the complex describing the interaction between TFIIE and TFIIH at the molecular level.

0077
To investigate whether the STDE is involved in the binding, we prepared a longer construct (residues 351–439) containing both acidic regions and performed the NMR titration experiment under the same conditions (Supplementary Figure 4). The result was that the NMR signals of STDE showed no significant changes and the Kd of 400±43 nM was almost the same as that estimated using hTFIIEα AC-D.
0077
This is supported by the result that the binding is strengthened by removing NaCl from the buffer in the NMR titration experiments.
0107
For yeast TFIIEα (Tfa1), functional significance of the C-terminal region and specific interaction between Tfa1 and Tfb1 has been reported (Bushnell et al, 1996; Kuldell and Buratowski, 1997). We aligned sequences of TFIIEα AC-D from other species to ascertain whether the interaction observed in human is evolutionally conserved (Figure 1A).
0096
The reason why transcription did not correlate well with the binding and CTD phosphorylation defects might be because there are more than 25 proteins involved in transcription, whereas only limited factors were used for both binding and phosphorylation studies (hTFIIEα AC-D mutants and p62 PH-D were used for binding studies and hTFIIEα AC-D mutants, hTFIIH and Pol II were used for CTD phosphorylation).
0096
In many cases, acidic TADs are disordered in an unbound form, but form an amphipathic helix upon binding to target proteins, for example, p53 TAD2–RPA70 (replication protein A 70) (Bochkareva et al, 2005), p53 TAD1–MDM2 (ubiquitin ligase) (Kussie et al, 1996), VP16 TAD–hTAFII31 (human TBP-associated factor) (Uesugi et al, 1997) complexes as well as the recently determined Tfb1 PH-D–p53 TAD2 complex (Di Lello et al, 2006).

0077
In the binding of VP16 TAD to Tfb1 PH-D, the Kd value estimated by NMR titration experiment was ∼4000–7000 nM (Di Lello et al, 2005).

In the binding of VP16 TAD to Tfb1 PH-D, the Kd value estimated by NMR titration experiment was ∼4000–7000 nM (Di Lello et al, 2005). Compared with these Kd values, the binding of hTFIIEα AC-D to p62 PH-D is rather strong.

0889
p62 has been shown to interact with the TADs of not only VP16 and p53 (Xiao et al, 1994) but also E2F-1 (Pearson and Greenblatt, 1997), and the oestrogen receptor α (ERα) (Chen et al, 2000).

0402
It can be imagined that if TFIIH is recruited by an activator near the promoter through its TAD then the recruited TFIIH could be captured by TFIIE instead of the activator to form the PIC. TFIIE regulates the enzymatic activities of TFIIH, which are necessary for the next stage after the PIC formation, that is, promoter melting or promoter clearance.

The NdeI–BamHI fragment of mutated hTFIIEα cDNA was subcloned into the pET11d vector (Novagen) making the N-terminal hexa histidine-tagged hTFIIEα (6H–hTFIIEα) expression plasmid. The NdeI–BamHI fragment of mutated hTFIIH p62 cDNA was subcloned into the pET vector making the N-terminal FLAG-tagged hTFIIH p62 PH-D (FLAG–p62 PH) expression plasmid.

Vav proteins contain multiple function motifs and are involved in various cellular signaling processes, including cytoskeleton organization, calcium influx, phagocytosis, and cell transformation [3]. Vav proteins share a common structure, including a N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain involved in Ca+2 mobilization and transforming activity, an acidic domain (AD) containing three regulatory tyrosines, a Dbl homology (DH) domain with a conserved region that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac/Rho GTPases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP3 that enables its movement to the inner face of the plasma membrane, two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains interacting with proteins containing proline-rich sequences, and a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain interacting with proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines [4,5].

0419
Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain, the folding is opened and the DH domain is exposed. Thus, Vav protein is activated and interacts with substrate proteins, and the PH domain is exposed for PIP3 binding [6].

We then determined whether knockdown expression of Vav3 inhibits growth of these breast cancer cells using Vav3 siRNA that has been characterized previously [25].

0426
Lipofectamine 2000 used for transfection of siRNA has been shown to knock down more than 80% activity of the endogenous gene in a panel of cells tested (Invitrogen).

0411
A growth stimulatory effect in response to estrogen stimulation was observed in T47D and MCF7 cells (Figure 2Eand 2F). We found that knockdown expression of Vav3 significantly inhibited both estrogen-dependent and -independent growth in these breast cancer cells (Figure 2Eand 2F). At 1.2 pM of siRNA, the growth of T47D and MCF7 cells was inhibited by 64% and 68% in the absence of estrogen and 46% and 77% in the presence of estrogen relative to their respective controls.
0411
Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the estrogen response element (ERE), ERα expression vector, and either Vav3 or Vav3* expression vector.

0411
Upregulation of the endogenous ERα activity by Vav3 relative to the empty vector pHEF was also confirmed in MCF7 cells by stimulation of luciferase reporter expression driven by ERE (Figure 3B) and natural promoter of ERα target gene pS2 (Figure 3C).
0411

Then, the cells were treated without or with E2 (10-9 M) and without or with Tamoxifen. (B and C) MCF7 cells (105 cells/well in 12-well plate) were cotransfected with ERE-Luc (0.5 ug) (B) or pS2-Luc (0.5 ug) (C), and expression vector (0.25 ug) for Vav3*, or empty vector pHEF, respectively.

A nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the PH domain was shown to be solely responsible for the nucleus localization of Vav1 protein, indicating a role of Vav family protein as a transcription coregulator. We have demonstrated that the DH domain of Vav3 is essential for AR and ERα activation (Figure 4) [25]. We performed sequence analysis of Vav proteins and found that the DH domain of Vav3 contains three consensus sequences of the LXXLL motifs or NR boxes, which have been well characterized and involved in interaction with nuclear receptors (Figure 6A). In addition, homologous analysis of Vav3 and Vav1 genes identified a conserved NLS in the PH domain of Vav3 (Figure 6B).

We performed GST pull down experiment to confirm the interaction between Vav3 and ERα.

A GST fusion protein including the DH and PH domain of Vav3 (GST-Vav3-DH+PH) was generated (Figure 7A). Cell extract derived from MCF7 cells was incubated with immobilized GST-Vav3-DH+PH fusion protein or GST protein.

0419
In summary, we found that Vav3 contains NLS in the PH domain and three LXXLL motifs in the DH domain. The deletion mutation and functional analysis by luciferase reporter assay showed that the DH domain of Vav3 is essential for enhancing ERα activity and is involved in complex with ERα.
0411
The knockdown expression of Vav3 compromised both estrogen-stimulated and -independent growth of breast cancer cells.

0419
Our findings support the notion that Vav3 overexpression may play a role in breast cancer, based on the following reasons: 1) Vav3 is overexpressed and correlated with poorly differentiated tumors in human breast cancer; 2) Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs and complexes with ERα; 3) Vav3 enhances ERα activity partially via the PI3K-Akt pathway; 4) Vav3 is a protein with multiple domains and functions, including the SH2 domain interacting with receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the PH domain binding PIP3 involved in association with the cell membrane, and the DH domain involved in interaction with ERα; 5) Vav3 potentiates EGF for cell growth and ERα activation.

Although Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar, activated Bax forms large oligomers that permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby committing cells to apoptosis, whereas Bcl-XL inhibits this process.

Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar members of the Bcl-2 family of cell-death-related proteins, and they compete for binding to membranes, as well as to Bcl-2 family member tBid and activated Bax.
0096
Another large subgroup of the Bcl-2 family (BH3-only proteins; e.g., tBid) initiates apoptosis through binding to Bax and/or Bcl-XL. Even though Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar, experiments with protein fragments and peptides or full-length protein in the absence of membranes has led to the elaboration of models in which the functional relevance of binding partners for Bcl-XL differ.

0096
However, there is also considerable overlap between these two competing models: both models recognize that Bcl-XL directly binds to and inhibits a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is directly involved in membrane permeabilization, while other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins indirectly induce apoptosis by binding to Bcl-XL and preventing this function.

0096
On the basis of these data and evidence from the literature, we have proposed a model termed “embedded together”, in which interaction of these proteins with each other changes after binding to the membrane as this causes conformational changes that alter and/or expose new binding surfaces [10,11].
0004
To eliminate complications from all other known and unknown proteins, metabolites, and post-translational modifications that may contribute additional levels of regulation, we used a cell-free system composed of highly purified full-length recombinant proteins, without N- or C-terminal tags, and as a source of membranes either liposomes with mitochondria-like composition [16] or subcellular fractions containing mitochondria.
0426
The large increase in fluorescence that accompanies the release of the fluorophore/quencher pair 8-aminonaphthalene 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS)/p-xylene-bis-pyridinium (DPX) from liposomes was used to measure Bax-dependent membrane permeabilization and its inhibition by Bcl-XL [7].

0663
As seen previously, single addition of recombinant Bax (100 nM) or tBid (20 nM) to liposomes had little effect, but in combination the two proteins caused an increase in fluorescence due to membrane permeabilization (Figure 1A).
0071
Membrane-bound proteins were separated from soluble proteins by Sepharose CL-2B gel filtration chromatography.

0019
Individual fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using Bid, Bax, or Bcl-XL antibodies, as indicated.
0107
In the absence of membranes, interaction between Bcl-XL and tBid could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data).
0006
Samples were immunoprecipitated (IP) in either 2% CHAPS or 0.2% NP-40, as indicated, using an antibody with the indicated specificity and immunoblotted (IB) for the indicated protein.
0019
Interaction of this peripheral membrane (indicated by the shadow) Bax with membrane-bound tBid causes a further conformational change such that Bax integrates in the membrane in an oligomerization competent form (step 2).

0096
Conversely, cytoplasmic Bax may interact with other activator proteins to integrate into membranes, or spontaneously active Bax molecules may integrate into the membrane without binding an activator protein.
0107
When tested in the absence of tBid, a stable interaction between Bax and Bcl-XL was not detected (Figure 2A, left panel, lane 3), suggesting that Bcl-XL does not sequester Bax in solution.

0054
However as expected, co-immunoprecipitation of Bcl-XL and Bax was observed in control experiments where membranes were solubilized with the nonionic detergent NP-40, known to induce a conformational change in Bax required for heterodimerization with Bcl-XL that is also seen in cells when apoptosis is induced [20,26].

0107
When tested in the presence of tBid (20 nM) and membranes, we did not detect an interaction between Bcl-XL (100 nM) and Bax (100 nM) (Figure 2A, left panel, lane 2).
0096
In these incubations, substitution of the wild-type proteins with tBid-mt1, Bcl-XL Y101K, or both showed similar effects to those seen in bak –/– MLM and liposomes (Figure 3C). Thus, in contrast to widely promulgated models for the antiapoptotic mechanism of Bcl-XL, our results with purified proteins in the presence of relevant membrane targets indicate that Bcl-XL binding to Bax and tBid are both functionally relevant, but neither is paramount.
0096
Alternatively or in addition, Bcl-XL might directly inhibit Bax binding to membranes. To determine the mechanism(s) involved, we measured Bax liposome binding by gel filtration chromatography for reactions containing the different mutant proteins (Figure 4A).
0107
The absence of a stable interaction between tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL significantly decreased Bcl-XL-mediated inhibition of Bax binding to membranes at all tBid concentrations assayed.
0054
At the onset of apoptosis in cells, Bcl-XL binds to membranes [23].

0426
At the onset of apoptosis in cells, Bcl-XL binds to membranes [23].
0019
Unlike the conformational change that accompanies tBid-induced insertion of Bax into membranes, the liposome-induced conformational change also disappears if liposomes are solubilized in CHAPS prior to immunoprecipitation (Figure 5A, compare lanes 1 and 3).
0006
Conformation-altered Bax was immunoprecipitated using the 6A7 antibody with or without the addition of 2% CHAPS to solubilize the liposomes prior to immunoprecipitation and analyzed by immunoblotting using an α-Bax antibody. The asterisk denotes the light chain of the 6A7 antibody.
0096
To determine whether the effect of membrane-bound Bcl-XL on this transient, liposome-induced conformational change in Bax could be regulated, BH3 peptides were used to induce selectively Bcl-XL binding to membranes (Text S1). On the basis of the effects previously published for mutations in BH3 domains of proapoptotic proteins and peptides, we selected two peptides that both caused membrane binding by Bcl-XL (Figure S5A) but differed in their functional effects (Figure S5B).
0054
Pioneering experiments to identify relevant binding partners for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL using immunoprecipitation in transfected cells suggested a lack of correlation between Bax binding and inhibition of apoptosis, as only certain Bcl-XL point mutants that could no longer bind to Bax lost function [40]. Further analysis of two of these Bcl-XL mutants that did not bind to Bax (the F131V/D133A mutant that remained functional and the inactive G138E/R139L/I140N mutant) suggested that prevention of apoptosis required binding to the BH3-only proteins tBid, Bim, and Bad, a function that was specifically lost in the latter mutant [19].

However, as these experiments were conducted on whole cells where Bax was also present, it is possible that the lack of function of this mutant is caused by the loss of binding to both BH3-only proteins (e.g., tBid) and Bax , a result entirely consistent with our observations.

0426
Conversely, early work with the M97A/D98A Bid mutant that does not bind to Bcl-XL [27,30] that we have used in our study (tBid mt1) indicated that Bcl-XL inhibited the apoptosis caused by this Bid mutant, in cells and in purified mitochondria, implying that the interaction with activated Bax rather than Bid was critical to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL in this context.

0096
Migration of the cytoplasmic fraction to membranes with insertion occurs during apoptosis [23,43,44] for Bcl-XL as well as other antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 [44] and Bcl-w [25,45]. For Bcl-w, interaction with a tethered Bim BH3 peptide displaces the C-terminal insertion sequence from the BH3 binding pocket within the protein triggering insertion of the protein into the membrane [25,46].

0081
We therefore determined whether peptides from the BH3 regions of Bid, Bim, Bad, Bax, and Bak caused insertion of Bcl-XL into liposomes, assayed by flotation on a sucrose gradient (Figure S6). All five peptides caused Bcl-XL to insert into membranes, while a mutant Bid peptide that fails to bind Bcl-XL [2] did not.
0019
Previous reports using transfected cells have indicated that the removal of the C-terminal insertion sequence of Bcl-XL severely impairs membrane insertion but has varying effects on Bcl-XL function, from moderate [29] to severe [50] reduction in function.

0426
Consistent with this variability, we have shown previously [37] that the function of ΔTM Bcl-XL compared to that of wild type is heavily dependent on the stimulus used to initiate apoptosis (and therefore possibly the BH3 protein(s) involved).

0054
However, in certain circumstances in cells ΔTM Bcl-XL may retain at least part of its antiapoptotic function in the cytoplasm depending on the location of relevant binding partners at the onset of apoptosis.

The liposomes that we used to model physiologic membranes have a high intrinsic curvature and lipid composition that facilitate membrane binding of the recombinant proteins and induction of the 6A7 conformational change in Bax.

0054
In cells, these feature are likely represented by complex and dynamic physiologic processes such as mitochondrial membrane fission and fusion shown to be important in apoptosis [52–54] and the interaction of mitochondria with other membrane systems [39,52,55]. The major observations reported here were confirmed for cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Figure 3B–D), suggesting that they will be relevant in live cells.

The major observations reported here were confirmed for cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Figure 3B–D), suggesting that they will be relevant in live cells. Moreover, the simplicity and power of our in vitro system using recombinant proteins and membranes has allowed us to identify and measure functionally important and potentially “druggable” interactions important for the regulation of apoptosis (Figure 6).

Recombinant full-length human Bcl-XL (or Bcl-XL Y101K) with no additional amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal intein/chitin-binding domain fusion and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column followed by further purification on a phenyl-Sepharose column, similar to a method described previously [7] but with a final dialysis step to remove detergents.
0663
Fluorescence (λex = 355 nm and λem = 520 nM) was measured for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of Bcl-XL but in the absence of Bax and tBid to obtain background values (F0). Bax and tBid (in that order) were added at t = 0, and fluorescence was measured for 2 h at 37 °C.
0096
Membrane binding was measured by comparing the intensities of membrane-bound proteins (fractions 3 and 4) with total proteins (fractions 3 and 4 plus fractions 8–11).

0096
To assess the membrane binding and membrane insertion of Bax and Bcl-XL into mitochondria, purified proteins, added in the order Bcl-XL, Bax, and tBid, were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with mitochondria (5 mg/ml) from bak –/– mice.

Loss of lin-12 signaling results in the specification of two ACs, whereas increased lin-12 signaling results in two VU cells. AC cells are readily quantified by examining expression of a lin-3p::gfp reporter construct [58].

In animals harboring this transgene, GFP expression was observed in numerous unidentified cells during embryonic development from the comma stage onward (unpublished data). GFP expression was observed in the VPCs during larval development, as well as various hypodermal cells during larval stages (Figure 4).

OSM-11 immunoreactivity was also observed in the seam cells of L1 larvae and adult animals (Figure 4A and 4D). In adult animals, osm-11p::gfp was expressed only in hypodermal seam cells in adult animals; hypodermal seam cell expression in adult animals was also confirmed with staining with OSM-11 antisera (Figure 4D). The larval hypodermal expression pattern of osm-11p::gfp is reminiscent of the osm-7p::gfp expression pattern described previously, but osm-7p::gfp expression in seam cells was not reported [52].

0226
OSM-11 protein was also expressed in the developing uterus of L4 larvae (Figure 4B) and in the spermatheca (Figure 4D); the LIN-12 Notch receptor plays a developmental role in these tissues as well [64], but only OSM-11 expression in VPCs was characterized further.

(C) OSM-11 expression in vulval precursor cells (VPCs; arrowheads) in L3 larvae. The top panels show α-OSM-11 antisera staining of VPCs prior (top left) and immediately after (top right) cell fate specification as assessed by lip-1p::gfp expression.

(D) OSM-11 expression in seam cells and spermatheca in adult animals. An osm-11p::gfp reporter gene containing unc-54 3′ UTR sequences is expressed in adult seam cells (left); α-OSM-11 antisera was used to confirm seam cell and spermatheca expression (right). No OSM-11 was detected in neurons of larvae or adult animals (unpublished data); embryonic expression was not characterized.

OSM-11 expression in Pn.p cells is consistent with a role for OSM-11 in initial cell fate specification.

Because the predicted peptide sequence of OSM-11 contains a signal peptide, we tested whether OSM-11 is a secreted protein. When an osm-11 cDNA was expressed in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells, OSM-11 protein accumulates in the media and not in cells (Figure 5A), consistent with OSM-11 acting in vivo as a soluble protein in the extracellular milieu.

DSL-1, OSM-11, LAG-2 extracellular domain (LAG-2Ex), EGL-17, or LIN-3 was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB); the first six LIN-12 EGF repeats were fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD). Pairwise interactions were tested with the yeast two-hybrid assay; positive interactions are indicated by blue staining.
0423
We found that OSM-11 also interacted with LIN-12 extracellular EGF repeats 1 through 6 (Figure 8); OSM-11 did not interact with DSL-1 or LAG-2 ligands. We also confirmed previous studies [50] in which murine DLK1 EGF repeats 1 and 2 containing the DOS motif interacted specifically with murine Notch1 EGF repeats 12 and 13 in the same two-hybrid assay format (unpublished data).

OSM-11 mRNA localization by in situ hybridization is consistent with expression in VPCs and hypoderm in young larvae and in seam cells in adult animals (see NEXTDB, http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/db2/ShowCloneInfo.php?clone=59g10; Y.

The osm-11 cDNA clone was obtained by PCR from the Vidal laboratory ORFeome cDNA library [94] and agrees exactly with the predicted sequence in WormBase and at NCBI. osm-11 cDNA constructs used herein for rescue contained the unc-54 3′ UTR, whereas genomic rescue clones contained the osm-11 3′ UTR.

Cell adhesion and migration are coordinated by dynamic membrane-associated protein assemblies called focal adhesions (FAs). With over 150 components, FAs play a crucial role in transmitting signals bidirectionally across the cell membrane and provide a physical link between integrin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton (Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007).

LD-binding proteins include the kinases FAK (Turner et al., 1999), ILK (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2001), and PAK3 (Hashimoto et al., 2001), the Arf-GAP PKL (Turner et al., 1999), the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Sheibani et al., 2008), the papillomavirus oncoprotein E6 (Tong et al., 1997), and the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin (Turner et al., 1999) and α-parvin (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000). While several of these proteins, such as FAK, PKL, and vinculin, bind LD motifs through parallel α-helical bundles (Gao et al., 2004; Hoellerer et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2002; Scheswohl et al., 2008; Schmalzigaug et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008), others employ topologically distinct modules, such as the kinase domain of ILK (Tu et al., 2001), the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 (Sorenson, 2004), and the calponin homology (CH) domain of α-parvin (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000).

α-parvin (Olski et al., 2001), also known as actopaxin (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000) or CH-ILKBP (Tu et al., 2001), is part of the ILK signaling complex (Tu et al., 2001), plays an essential role in adhesion-dependent PKB/Act activation (Fukuda et al., 2003) and in the regulation of actin organization (LaLonde et al., 2005) and Rac activation (LaLonde et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2004). It belongs to the highly conserved parvin family that shares a common architecture composed of a variable N-terminal region followed by two CH domains (Olski et al., 2001).

However, the primary sequences of both CH domains of α-parvin are highly diverged from the typical type-1 and type-2 CH domains found in ABDs; they have therefore been classified as type-4 and type-5 CH domains (Gimona et al., 2002). An ability to recognize paxillin LD motifs has only been reported for the type-5 CH domains (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000; Yoshimi et al., 2006).

Three cocrystal structures of α-parvin-CHC with 20-residue peptides representing LD1, LD2, and LD4 allow us to characterize the interaction at atomic resolution and to highlight binding-induced conformational changes in α-parvin-CHC. This analysis together with NMR studies of a spin-labeled LD1 peptide supports the surprising finding that LD motifs can associate with a single binding site bidirectionally.

We initially attempted to solve the crystal structure of full-length human α-parvin, but no crystals could be obtained.

This fragment includes residues 242–372 and thereby spans the entire C-terminal CH domain as defined by SMART (Schultz et al., 1998) and a portion of the inter-CH domain linker (Figure 1A).

In spite of very low levels of sequence conservation (≤26% identity) compared to canonical type-1 CH domains (see Figure S1 available online), α-parvin-CHC exhibits a typical CH domain core composed of four main α-helices (αA, αC, αE, and αG; nomenclature from Djinovic Carugo et al., 1997), which are connected by loops and shorter helical elements (αD and αF).

However, conformational differences in this region may not be significant, since the C/E-loop structure varies between α-parvin-CHC molecules both in the same and different crystal forms and is involved in crystal packing (data not shown).

On the basis of primary sequence comparison with other LD-binding proteins, such as FAK and vinculin, and mutation studies, the LD-binding site (or “paxillin binding subdomain” [PBS]) of α-parvin was mapped to residues 274–291 (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000) (i.e., the A/C-loop of α-parvin-CHC) (Figure 1B).

0030
However, we previously demonstrated that LD-binding to the FAT domain of FAK does not reside in a local peptide sequence such as the PBS (Hoellerer et al., 2003) and thus investigated the interaction of α-parvin-CHC with LD motifs using solution NMR.

To confirm this striking result, we built models corresponding to both possible orientations for each LD-peptide complex and subjected them to simulated annealing refinement using PHENIX (Afonine et al., 2007).

Likewise, comparison of the chemical shift perturbations imposed by oppositely aligned peptides on backbone amide resonances of α-parvin-CHC (Figure 2) is inconclusive. We note that the peptide side-chains contacting the LD-binding site of α-parvin-CHC are similar in either orientation (Figure S4), as is the conformational rearrangement induced by peptide binding, so that the perturbation patterns of either unidirectional binding mode (or a bidirectional mixture) may be indistinguishable.
0077
This phenomenon is also illustrated in Figure 5, using two diagnostic NMR signals as examples: the resonance originating from residue 257 is predicted to experience strong PRE in the forward mode (calculated distance from spin-label 10.7 Å) but should only be weakly affected in the backward mode (calculated distance 20.2 Å).

Our results demonstrate that full-length α-parvin contains a single LD binding site, formed by the N-linker helix, helix A, and helix G of the C-terminal type-5 CH domain. This binding site is consistent with the one described in a recent solution NMR structure of α-parvin-CHC in complex with an LD1 peptide (Wang et al., 2008).

The significantly lower value of ∼1.2 mM recently measured (Wang et al., 2008) might be due to the restricted length of the peptide (10 versus 20 residues) used in their study.

The FAT domain of FAK contains two independent LD binding sites, which bind equally well to LD2 and LD4 in vitro (Hoellerer et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004), but it also interacts to some degree with the other LD motifs (M.K.H., unpublished results). Recent NMR studies (Zhang et al., 2008) have also demonstrated that the single LD binding site of PKL/GIT1 binds to both LD4 (Turner et al., 1999) and LD2. Taken together, these observations suggest that paxillin LD motifs are promiscuous protein interaction modules.

On the basis of our results for α-parvin, we can make two general predictions with respect to LD recognition by CH domains: First, as noted previously (Wang et al., 2008), we propose that the presence of an N-linker helix is a prerequisite for the interaction with LD motifs.

Interestingly, γ-parvin was shown to associate with paxillin in vivo (Yoshimi et al., 2006). Available experiments with β-parvin, however, have proved negative to date (Yamaji et al., 2004), although this protein is more similar in sequence to α-parvin than is γ-parvin (Figure 1C).

The structure of α-parvin-CHC is topologically distinct from other LD-binding domains, such as the FAT domain of FAK; it associates with a single LD motif across three oblique helices, whereas FAT accommodates two LD motifs in parallel fashion on opposite sites of its 4-helical bundle (Hoellerer et al., 2003).

In both cases, LD motifs adopt an α-helical conformation when bound, which allows the conserved leucine residues on one face of the helix to interact with the hydrophobic binding site. Notably, the role of electrostatic contacts in LD recognition might differ between the two proteins: while substitutions of the conserved aspartates (D+1) of LD2 and LD4 to alanine were found to abolish the interaction of N-terminal paxillin fragments with FAT (Brown et al., 1996; Scheswohl et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 1999), our study and others (Wang et al., 2008) show that the equivalent substitutions in the isolated LD1 peptides do not significantly perturb α-parvin-CHC binding in vitro.

This could explain a similar PRE experiment performed with a shorter LD1 variant (residues 3–13), which was interpreted as unidirectional forward-type binding and used to restrain the solution structure of the LD1/α-parvin-CHC complex (Wang et al., 2008).

Although α−parvin has been shown to bind to F-actin with an affinity comparable to other CH domain-containing actin-binding proteins (Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000; Olski et al., 2001), the canonical model of actin recognition may not apply to this protein. Usually CH domains bind F-actin through a tandem array of an N-terminal type-1 CH domain containing two actin-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2) and a C-terminal type-2 CH domain contributing a third actin-binding site (ABS3) (Gimona et al., 2002).

CH domains in intact ABDs often interact across a sizeable interface, which can modulate their ability to interact with F-actin (Gimona et al., 2002). It remains to be established whether such intramolecular interactions occur to regulate the association of α-parvin with F-actin and other binding partners, such as paxillin, TESK1 (LaLonde et al., 2005), and ILK (Tu et al., 2001).

The resulting values were used as approximation of the distances, r, of the unpaired electron of the PROXYL moiety to the backbone amide protons and to derive residue-specific PRE-values, I/I0, according to (Jain et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 1999) (for details, see Figure S5).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments show that Ctk1 associates with RNApII throughout elongation (Kim et al, 2004a).
0676
Consistent with this, when ChIP was carried out using strains deleted for the other subunits of the Ctk1 complex, including Ctk2 (cyclin subunit) or Ctk3 (accessory factor), TBP occupancy was again increased in the coding region of PMA1 (Supplementary Figure S1).

The upstream activating sequence (UAS; Figure 1A) of the three genes used in our studies (PMA1, ADH1, and PYK1) contain a binding site for repressor-activator protein 1 (Rap 1), a transactivator for many promoters in exponentially growing cells (Rao et al, 1993; Lieb et al, 2001).

The upstream activating sequence (UAS; Figure 1A) of the three genes used in our studies (PMA1, ADH1, and PYK1) contain a binding site for repressor-activator protein 1 (Rap 1), a transactivator for many promoters in exponentially growing cells (Rao et al, 1993; Lieb et al, 2001). The UAS from all three genes show strong Rap1 cross-linking, and this signal remains appropriately localized in ctk1Δ cells (Figure 3C).

As serine 2 phosphorylation is known to be required for cotranscriptional 3′-end processing (Ahn et al, 2004), we also tested for the polyadenylation factor Rna14 as a positive control (Figure 4B).

Two mutant alleles were employed: ctk1-D324N is a catalytic site mutant that shows no kinase activity in vitro and confers a slow-growth, cold-sensitive phenotype in vivo, whereas ctk1-T338A is a weakened kinase mutated in the T-loop threonine that accepts an activating phosphorylation (Ostapenko and Solomon, 2003).

Cells deficient in Ctk1 were deleted at the genomic locus but covered by pCTK1, a low-copy URA3 plasmid containing WT Ctk1. Before our analyses, cells were grown overnight on YPD, streaked onto 5-FOA to select for those who lost the covering plasmid (confirmed by slow growth) and immediately used for subsequent experiments.

For Rpb3 immunoprecipitation, antibody (1Y26, NeoClone) was preincubated with protein G-sepharose (Amersham).

0019
The signal for each specific gene primer in the immunoprecipitation was then divided by this ratio to convert the signal to normalized units. This value was divided by the immunoprecipitation signal of the non-transcribed control product to determine the fold enrichment of the ChIP over background signals.

Cells were grown at 22°C, shifted to 37°C (non-permissive temperature) for 4 h as indicated, and prepared for ChIP analysis. (E) The Ctk1-deficient strain (YSB854) was transformed with either of the plasmids YCplac22 (empty vector), YCplac22-CTK1HA (T338A), YCplac22-CTK1-DN, or pRS316-CTK1 and used for ChIP analysis.

(D) Efficiency of scaffold formation was measured by quantitation of band intensities from lane 3 or 7 in WT and ctk1Δ cells (ImageJ v1.32).

0006
To measure the association between RNApII and the basal transcription factors after termination, the supernatant was removed after incubation with NTPs for 2 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-Rpb3 antibody.
