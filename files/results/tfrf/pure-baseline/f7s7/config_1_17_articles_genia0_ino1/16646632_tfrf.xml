The cytoplasmic tails of both gE and gI contain potential endocytosis motifs, and studies of gE and gI in HSV-1 and other alphaherpesviruses have demonstrated that gE, gI, and gE-gI undergo endocytosis and recycling [11]. The discovery that gE-gI binding to Fc is sharply pH dependent, such that binding is observed at neutral or slightly basic pH but not at acidic pH, suggests that IgG bound by cell-surface gE-gI would dissociate if endocytosed together with gE-gI into intracellular vesicles [12]. In addition, the pH dependence of the gE-gI/Fc interaction allows speculation that the participation of gE-gI in antibody bipolar bridging plays an active role in clearing the cell surface of host IgG and of viral antigens, whereby endocytosis of HSV antigens bound to gE-gI–associated anti-HSV IgG is followed by dissociation of the IgG-antigen complexes in degradative compartments such as lysosomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4064</offset><text>Several studies have identified regions of gE, gI, and Fc that are critical to the gE-gI and gE-gI/IgG interactions. Although the gE-gI heterodimer is required for high-affinity binding of monomeric IgG, gE alone is a low-affinity FcR that binds isolated Fc [12] as well as IgG in immune complexes, such as IgG-coated erythrocytes [1,13]. Because isolated gI binds neither free IgG nor IgG in immune complexes [13], it is unlikely to contain a significant Fc binding interface. The Fc binding region on gE has been localized to the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) [14,15], whereas the N-terminal domain of gE (NgE) associates with gI, forming a complex that does not bind to IgG [16]. The region of the gE-gI heterodimer that is important for cell-to-cell spread of HSV has also been mapped to CgE [17,18].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4933</offset><text>The gE-gI-binding site on IgG has been localized to the Fc CH2-CH3 interdomain hinge, a “hot spot” that serves as the binding site for several other mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins [19,20]. Residues critical to the interaction were identified in binding studies comparing the affinities of human IgG subtypes for gE-gI, which found that gE-gI binds to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 with similar affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD] ˜40–400 nM), but does not bind several IgG3 allotypes or an IgG4 mutant in which His435 was changed to an arginine [21,22]. These results implicate a role for Fc His435, which is an arginine in most human IgG3 allotypes, and are consistent with a previous suggestion that gE-gI and protein A have overlapping binding sites at the CH2-CH3 domain interface of Fc [23]. Additional studies using a nonbinding Fc mutant (nbFc), which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 hinge, confirmed the gE-gI binding site on Fc and established the stoichiometry as two gE-gI heterodimers per one Fc dimer (2:1) [12], analogous to the binding stoichiometries for all known FcR/Fcγ interactions that involve the Fc CH2-CH3 domain interface [19,24–28].</text><annotation id="5"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0107</infon><location offset="5135" length="370"/><text>Residues critical to the interaction were identified in binding studies comparing the affinities of human IgG subtypes for gE-gI, which found that gE-gI binds to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 with similar affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD] ˜40–400 nM), but does not bind several IgG3 allotypes or an IgG4 mutant in which His435 was changed to an arginine [21,22].</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6227</offset><text>In order to study the interaction between gE-gI and Fc in more detail, we initiated structural studies of gE, gE-gI, and a gE-gI/Fc complex. gE-gI heterodimers are resistant to crystallization, but we were able to determine structures of a gE fragment and a gE-gI complex with Fc.

To determine whether isolated CgE (gE residues 213–390, where residue 1 is the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE and residue 420 is the first residue of the predicted transmembrane region) binds Fc and to measure the affinity of the interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance assay using two forms of recombinant Fc derived from human IgG1: wild-type Fc (wtFc) and nbFc, which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 linker that abrogate binding to gE-gI (Met252 to Gly, Ile253 to Gly, His310 to Glu, His433 to Glu, His435 to Glu, and Tyr436 to Ala) [12]. The Fc proteins were immobilized on the surface of a biosensor chip, and the binding of CgE was assayed at pH 8 and pH 6. Significant binding of CgE to nbFc was not observed under any conditions (unpublished data), but CgE binds wtFc with a KD of ˜7 μM at pH 8 (Figure 1A and1C). The relatively low affinity of the CgE/Fc interaction likely explains why a CgE/Fc binding interaction was not detectable by coimmunoprecipitation analyses [16]. The affinity of CgE for Fc is similar to that determined for the interaction of gE with Fc at pH 8 (KD ˜30 μM), but ˜50-fold weaker than the affinity of the gE-gI/Fc interaction, which has KD values of 340 nM and 930 nM for the first and second binding sites on wtFc, respectively [12]. As previously observed for the interaction of gE-gI with Fc [12], the binding of CgE to Fc is much weaker at pH 6 than at pH 8 (Figure 1A and1B). In combination with previous data, these results suggest that the gI chain contributes to the gE-gI interaction with Fc either directly or through stabilizing the binding conformation of gE, that NgE does not contribute to Fc binding, and that at least some of the pH dependence of the gE-gI interaction with Fc can be attributed to the CgE/Fc interface.</text><annotation id="9"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0107</infon><location offset="7607" length="603"/><text>To determine whether isolated CgE (gE residues 213–390, where residue 1 is the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE and residue 420 is the first residue of the predicted transmembrane region) binds Fc and to measure the affinity of the interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance assay using two forms of recombinant Fc derived from human IgG1: wild-type Fc (wtFc) and nbFc, which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 linker that abrogate binding to gE-gI (Met252 to Gly, Ile253 to Gly, His310 to Glu, His433 to Glu, His435 to Glu, and Tyr436 to Ala) [12].</text></annotation><annotation id="10"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="7607" length="725"/><text>To determine whether isolated CgE (gE residues 213–390, where residue 1 is the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE and residue 420 is the first residue of the predicted transmembrane region) binds Fc and to measure the affinity of the interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance assay using two forms of recombinant Fc derived from human IgG1: wild-type Fc (wtFc) and nbFc, which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 linker that abrogate binding to gE-gI (Met252 to Gly, Ile253 to Gly, His310 to Glu, His433 to Glu, His435 to Glu, and Tyr436 to Ala) [12].

CgE is composed primarily of 14 β-strands organized into three β-sheets, two of which pack together in a manner resembling an Ig variable (V) fold (Figure 2A and2B). The first and second β-sheets in CgE, which correspond to their counterparts in Ig V domains, contain strands A, B, B′, E, and D, and strands A′, G, F, C, C′, and C′′, respectively. A third sheet, which is not found in Ig V domains or other Ig superfamily members, is a parallel β-sheet containing strands CI, CI′, and I′′ (strands denoted with “I” are part of the “inserted” β-sheet, with strands CI and CI′ proceeding strand C) (Figure 2A and2B). The third β-sheet packs against the backside of the A′GFCC′C′′ sheet on the opposite face from the DEBB′A sheet (Figure 2A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10567</offset><text>A 3-D search of the protein database using the DALI server [29] identified the coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor domain 1 (pdb entry 1eaj) and a mouse Fv (pdb entry 1mfa) as two of its closest structural neighbors, with root mean square deviations of 2.6 Å over 108 Cα atoms and 2.8 Å over 106 Cα atoms, respectively (Figure S1). The structural similarity between CgE and its structural homologs does not include the third β-sheet found in CgE. In addition, CgE contains disulfide bonds that are not typically found in Ig superfamily folds: Cys271–Cys297, which joins the N-terminal ends of the CI and CI′ strands; Cys280–Cys289, between residues within the helices near the CI and CI′ strands; and Cys314–Cys323, between residues within the complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR2) loop (Figure 2A and2B). The CgE fold lacks the disulfide bond that joins the A′GFCC′C′′ and the DEBB′A sheets in the canonical Ig fold, with CgE containing a cysteine in strand F (Cys359) but a valine in the complementary position in strand B (Val244). However, the conserved tryptophan normally found in strand C adjacent to the intersheet disulfide bond is present in CgE (Trp262). Further structural differences include the extension of strands C, C′, and C′′ as well as the A′–B and C′–C′′ loops, and the shortening of strands D and E as compared to a representative Ig V domain (Figure S1A), which leads to a more open organization of the first two β-sheets (sheets DEBB′A and A′GFCC′C′′).

However, CgE has an Ig V folding topology, whereas host Ig superfamily FcγRs are C2-type Ig domains (reviewed in [30]). As a result, the 38-residue region of sequence similarity does not adopt a similar structure in CgE and the FcγRs: CgE residues 322–359 encompass strands C′′, D, E, and F, whereas strands C′′ and D are absent in C2-type Ig domains, and the predicted Cys323-Cys359 disulfide bond [14] is not present; instead Cys323 is in a disulfide bond with Cys314, and Cys359 is not bonded to another cysteine (Figure 2C and2D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13507</offset><text>The only other FcR of known structure to adopt an Ig V domain fold is the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), which contains an N-terminal V-like domain that binds to polymeric IgA and IgM [31].

The complex crystals could not be improved by changing the gE-gI or Fc construct or by manipulating the crystals (summarized inMaterials and Methods). A 5.0-Å native data set was collected from the best of several hundred crystals (Table S2) and used for molecular replacement with the IgG Fc (pdb entry 1dn2) and CgE structures as search models. A molecular replacement solution was obtained when the Fc was positioned first followed by two CgE molecules, one bound to each Fc chain. Although the volume of the asymmetric unit could accommodate one to three gE-gI/Fc complexes [32], further searches did not reveal additional Fc or CgE molecules, suggesting that the gE-gI/Fc crystals contain a single 2:1 complex of gE-gI/Fc.

Other features of the molecular replacement solution suggest that it is correct. First, two CgE molecules are bound to each Fc dimer, in agreement with the observed stoichiometry of the gE-gI/Fc interaction [12]. Second, although symmetry was not imposed, the solution is nearly perfectly two-fold symmetric with the two-fold axis relating the two CgE molecules coinciding with the Fc dyad axis and each CgE molecule making similar contacts with the same region of an Fc chain. Finally, the CgE molecules are positioned to interact with the CH2-CH3 linker region of Fc, consistent with previous biochemical analyses of the gE-gI/Fc interaction [12,21].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16508</offset><text>We used experimental phasing methods to independently corroborate the molecular replacement model. A screen of complex crystals that had been soaked in various heavy-atom compounds resulted in four approximately isomorphous data sets (Table S2). An initial analysis of a KIrCl3 derivative identified five iridium sites located near the Fc molecule as positioned in the molecular replacement solution, four of which are related by the Fc dimer symmetry and two of which make a chemically-plausible interaction with a methionine (Met358) on each half of the Fc dimer (Figure 3B). Phases were calculated after locating heavy atom sites for the other derivatives (PIP, EMP, and Na2WO4) and used to find the locations of 13 of 18 potential selenium-substituted methionines in a crystal of SeMet-substituted gE-gI complexed with Fc. A comparison of the identified selenium sites with the molecular replacement model showed that eight of the 13 sites mapped to the eight methionine residues in CgE (Figure 3B). The clustering of all of the heavy atom sites around the Fc molecule provides further support for only one copy of the complex in the asymmetric unit. An overlay of the molecular replacement model with a 5-Å heavy atom–phased electron density map (Figure S2) shows overlap of the model with electron density, including density for theN-linked carbohydrates attached to the CH2 domain of Fc, and extra density that likely corresponds to gI and NgE. Thus, experimental phasing methods using a combination of heavy-atom derivatives and SeMet-substituted crystals provides further confirmation of the molecular replacement solution and validates its use as a model for the CgE/Fc interaction in the context of the gE-gI/Fc complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18303</offset><text>Independent Prediction of the CgE/Fc Interaction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18352</offset><text>A complementary, computational approach was carried out in parallel to the crystallographic work in order to model the CgE/Fc interaction independently using an improved version of RosettaDock [33,34]. RosettaDock uses real-space Monte Carlo minimization on both rigid-body and side-chain degrees of freedom to identify the lowest free energy docked arrangement of two protein structures and can be guided by biological constraints when available. Docking was carried out in three steps using the CgE structure and one chain of the two-fold symmetric Fc used in the molecular replacement search. In the first step, a global search through possible rigid-body orientations of the CgE and Fc proteins was carried out with the constraint that the CgE/Fc interface contains at least one of the six residues in the consensus binding site on Fc (Met252, Ile253, Ser254, Asn434, His435, and Tyr436) [19]. In similar calculations on a number of other complexes [35], a small number of closely related models that are significantly lower in energy than others is observed, and in such cases, these low-energy models are almost always close to the correctly docked structure. The magnitude of the energy gap between the correct models and other models is correlated with the binding affinity of the interaction [33]. Perhaps because of the relatively low binding affinity of the CgE/Fc interaction (Figure 1C), we did not observe a significant energy gap in this case, and hence could not confidently identify a single model as correct based on the global docking calculations alone. Instead, we proceeded by clustering the lowest-energy models based on structural similarity and further pruning high-ranked (large-sized) clusters by imposing a second constraint that CgE interacts with both the CH2 and CH3 domains of Fc, which has been observed for other interactions with the consensus Fc binding site [19]. In the last step, the centers of the top five clusters were subjected to rigid-body and side-chain torsion refinement, and the lowest energy models from each refinement run were selected as the final predictions. Of the five resulting models for the CgE/Fc interaction, one is similar to the crystallographic model obtained by molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods (Figure 3C).</text><annotation id="18"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0107</infon><location offset="19518" length="407"/><text>The magnitude of the energy gap between the correct models and other models is correlated with the binding affinity of the interaction [33].

Each of the Fc-binding proteins is different in sequence and structure; however, their binding interactions with Fc are similar, sharing a set of six contact residues on Fc that have been referred to as the consensus region [19,27]. Interface interactions involving side-chain atoms of Fc residues Met252, Ile253, Ser254, Asn434, His435, and Tyr436 and the adjacent peptide backbone are found in each of the five FcR/Fc interfaces [19,27], and are predicted to occur in the CgE/Fc interface (Figure 4A). Likewise, the gE-gI/Fc structure suggests that the interface with CgE contains at least two conserved interactions with Fc that are found in three or more of the five FcR/Fc interfaces [19,27]: hydrophobic packing onto Fc His435 by gE Pro319 and gE Pro321, and hydrophobic packing onto Fc Met252 and Fc Tyr436 by gE His247 (Figure 4A). Similar to the binding interfaces for the other five proteins that bind the CH2-CH3 linker region of Fc [19,20,27], the CgE/Fc interface is primarily nonpolar with a total of ˜1800 Å2 of buried surface area.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23451</offset><text>The gE-gI/Fc model is consistent with previous observations regarding the characteristics of Fc binding by gE-gI.

Similarly, the lack of gE-gI binding by allotypes of human IgG3 that contain a His to Arg substitution at position 435 compared to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 [21,22] is likely due in part to the unfavorable energetic consequences of burying an extended, charged residue in the small hydrophobic pocket formed by gE residues Pro319 and Pro321 (Figure 4A). A comparison of the sequences of the Fc regions of the human, rabbit, and rat IgG subclasses, focusing on the Fc residues that the gE-gI/Fc model predicts to be important for Fc binding (Fc residues 252–258, 307, 309–311, 314–315, 382, 428, and 433–436), suggests a molecular basis for the observation that gE-gI binds to human and rabbit IgG, but not to rodent IgG [21,36]. Many of the Fc residues in or near the interface are either identical or conservatively substituted in human, rabbit, and rat; however, differences at positions 252, 255, 258, and 382 (human/rabbit Met252, Arg255, Glu258, and Glu382 versus rat Thr/Leu/Met252, Leu/Gln255, Lys258, and Gln/Lys/Thr/Glu382) could perturb the interface such that gE-gI does not bind rat IgG.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>25135</offset><text>Mechanism of pH-Dependent Binding</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25169</offset><text>Previous studies demonstrated a sharply pH-dependent interaction for HSV-1–infected cells binding to rabbit IgG [37] and for soluble gE-gI or gE monomers binding to human Fc [12], such that binding occurs at neutral or slightly basic pH but not at acidic pH.

The residues in the vicinity of these histidines are generally nonpolar, and protonation of a histidine residue at acidic pH results in a positive charge that would be unfavorable if buried in a hydrophobic environment or near another positively charged residue.

Six of the sites that are not accounted for by CgE or Fc, and thus attributed to NgE or gI, are related by the Fc dyad axis (i.e., two sets of three heavy-atom sites), consistent with the two-fold symmetry of the complex that results from the inherent symmetry of the Fc dimer. These results constrain NgE and the gI ectodomain to occupy a position below CgE in the CgE/Fc model as shown inFigure 3B, in agreement with the presence of extra density that is not accounted for by the models for CgE or Fc in experimental electron density maps (unpublished data). Given that NgE is covalently attached to the N-terminus of CgE, we predict that NgE and gI, which is tethered to the membrane and interacts with NgE [16], are both located below CgE, as depicted schematically inFigure 5. The assignment of the NgE and gI domains in the vicinity of the Fc CH3 domain is consistent with the suggestion that additional binding surfaces on Fc include CH3 domain residues 356 and 358 [45]. The same study reported that allotypic changes in residue 214 in the IgG1 CH1 domain affected binding by gE-gI, which might be explained if flexibility in the hinge region between the Fab arms and Fc allowed contact of CH1 with the CgE portion of gE-gI.

Our analysis of gE-gI/Fc affinity as a function of pH suggested that the pH-dependent binding was due to protonation of two residues, likely histidines, in Fc and/or gE [12]. As CgE also shows pH-dependent binding to Fc (Figure 1), the CgE/Fc model derived from the gE-gI/Fc structure can be used to identify candidate residues involved in the pH-dependent interaction, which include four histidines in the CgE/Fc interface (His247 on gE and His310, His433, and His435 on Fc) (Figure 4A). Interestingly, His310 and His435 are two of the three Fc histidines that have been identified as conferring a sharp pH-dependence to the FcRn/Fc interaction [27]. In the FcRn/Fc complex these histidines are buried in titratable salt bridges that are disrupted at neutral or basic pH [27], whereas the histidines in the CgE/Fc interface are buried in a hydrophobic environment that would be disrupted upon protonation of the histidines at acidic pH, resulting in the acquisition of a positive charge.

Mapping of insertion mutations in gE that affect viral spread [17,18,39] on the CgE and gE-gI/Fc complex structures identifies a region of CgE that could interact with receptors for gE-gI (Figure 4B). Although the structure-based interpretation of the insertion mutagenesis studies on CgE suggests that the surface of the protein involved in cell-to-cell spread of the virus is distant from the Fc-binding interface (Figure 4B), it is currently unclear whether the cell-to-cell spread and IgG binding functions of gE-gI are correlated. Viruses with insertions in gE after positions 333 and 339, which are at or near the crystallographically observed CgE/Fc interface, are disrupted for IgG binding but spread normally, suggesting that IgG binding is not required for cell-to-cell spread [7,17,38]. Consistent with this possibility, cell-to-cell spread has been observed in the absence of IgG when extracellular spread is blocked by the presence of solid matrices. However, the extent of cell-to-cell spread is influenced by the presence of anti–HSV-1 IgGs that contain Fc regions that can bind to gE-gI [47], suggesting a role for antibody bipolar bridging. A positive correlation between cell-to-cell spread and antibody bipolar bridging could be explained by a mechanism involving increased endocytosis of gE-gI bound to anti-HSV/HSV antigen complexes, dissociation and degradation of anti-HSV IgG in acidic vesicles, and transport of gE-gI to the trans-Golgi network [48,49], where it would be available for viral packaging [50].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38443</offset><text>The crystallographic data can be used to deduce a model for how IgG binds gE-gI on the surface of virions or infected cells, whereby CgE binds the consensus Fc-binding site on each half of the Fc dimer, and gI and the NgE are located underneath the CgE domain between the CH3 domains of Fc and the membrane (Figure 5). Critical to interpretation of gE-gI recognition of IgG in vivo is the prediction that intact IgG is bound in an “upright” orientation, with the CH3 domains of the Fc closest to the membrane and the Fab arms furthest away. Similarly, FcαRI binds the IgA Fc in an upright orientation [41], whereas in other host FcR/Ig complexes of known structure (the FcγRIII/Fcγ and FcɛRI/Fcɛ complexes), the receptor-bound antibody is oriented with its Fabs closest to the membrane [42–44].

However, an anti-HSV antibody that is bound to both gE-gI and an HSV antigen on the surface of an infected cell could be sterically hindered from also binding to host FcγRs or C1q due to the close proximity of the proteins in the antibody bipolar bridging complex. Evasion of the host immune response may also be facilitated by the pH sensitivity of the gE-gI/Fc interaction [12]. The demonstration that the gE-gI/Fc structure is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging (Figure 5) raises the possibility that anti-HSV IgG/HSV antigen complexes interacting with gE-gI on the surface of infected cells are endocytosed by gE-gI and degraded in the lysosomes after dissociation at acidic pH, resulting in destruction of antiviral antibodies and removal of viral antigens from the cell surface.</text><annotation id="31"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0081</infon><location offset="39541" length="355"/><text>The gE-gI binding site on Fc does not directly overlap with the binding sites for the FcγRs or the C1q component of complement, which bind on or near the CH2 domain [43,44,51], thus the structure of the gE-gI/Fc complex does not directly suggest how gE-gI binding to the Fc region of IgG leads to evasion of FcγR- and complement-mediated immune responses.</text></annotation><annotation id="32"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="39541" length="355"/><text>The gE-gI binding site on Fc does not directly overlap with the binding sites for the FcγRs or the C1q component of complement, which bind on or near the CH2 domain [43,44,51], thus the structure of the gE-gI/Fc complex does not directly suggest how gE-gI binding to the Fc region of IgG leads to evasion of FcγR- and complement-mediated immune responses.</text></annotation><annotation id="33"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0416</infon><location offset="40278" length="410"/><text>The demonstration that the gE-gI/Fc structure is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging (Figure 5) raises the possibility that anti-HSV IgG/HSV antigen complexes interacting with gE-gI on the surface of infected cells are endocytosed by gE-gI and degraded in the lysosomes after dissociation at acidic pH, resulting in destruction of antiviral antibodies and removal of viral antigens from the cell surface.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>40726</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>40748</offset><text>Purification and expression of CgE.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40784</offset><text>Our numbering scheme defines the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE protein as residue 1.

Initial molecular replacement trials with the Fc coordinates clearly distinguished between the enantiomeric space groups P41212 and P43212 (log-likelihood gain of 44.7 for P41212 versus 92.6 for P43212), with P43212 being the correct space group.

The positions of the first and second CgE molecules on each Fc chain were almost perfectly related by the dyad axis of the Fc, thus the CgE/Fc interface on each half complex is similar, with a slight translational shift of ˜2 Å for the second CgE molecule relative to the first. Because the asymmetric unit could contain one, two, or three 2:1 complexes, attempts were made to locate additional complexes, including searching for additional Fc molecules, searching for half complexes of one CgE and one Fc chain, and searching for additional 2:1 complexes.
