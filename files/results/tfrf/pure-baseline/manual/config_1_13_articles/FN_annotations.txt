To assess whether MELK has a role in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous MELK in breast cancer cell lines using mammalian vector-based RNA interference. Furthermore, we identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a possible substrate for MELK by pull-down assay with recombinant wild-type and kinase-dead MELK.
0424
To use the long isoform Bcl-GL recombinant protein as a substrate for kinase assay, a set of Flag-tagged Bcl-GL (FL, N-1, N-2 N-3 and N-4) expression vectors was transfected into HeLa cells, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with Flag-conjugated agarose M2 gel (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 1 hour.
0096
To investigate the biological functions of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for substrates of MELK in cancer cells by in vitro protein pull-down assays using wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK) recombinant proteins. Comparison of silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels containing the pulled-down proteins identified an approximately 30 kDa protein in the lane corresponding to proteins pulled-down with WT-MELK but not in that corresponding to proteins pulled-down with D150A-MELK (Figure 3a).
0096
Thus, to investigate the biological significance of MELK in breast cancer cells, we searched for a possible substrate(s) of MELK by means of in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant wild-type MELK (WT-MELK) and kinase-dead MELK (D150A-MELK).

In addition, we found that Cdk5 is involved in BDNF-induced activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42, which is essential for BDNF-triggered dendritic growth. Our observations therefore reveal an unanticipated role of Cdk5 in TrkB-mediated regulation of dendritic growth through modulation of BDNF-induced Cdc42 activation.
0006
To explore the potential interplay between Trk receptors and Cdk5, we first examined if Trk receptors associated with Cdk5 or p35. TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC was overexpressed together with Cdk5 or p35 in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed with Cdk5, p35, or pan-Trk antibody. Interestingly, all three Trk receptors were observed to associate with Cdk5 (Figure 1B) and p35 (Figure 1C), while no association was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG control. Since both TrkB and its ligand BDNF are abundantly expressed in the brain throughout development, we next proceeded to verify the interaction between TrkB and Cdk5/p35 in postnatal brains. We found that TrkB associated with both p35 and Cdk5 in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat brain lysates (Figure 1D).
0006
TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were overexpressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated by pan-Trk antibody. Incubation with Cdk5/p25 revealed that TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, were phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25 in vitro (Figure 2A). This is in agreement with the lack of Cdk5 consensus sites in TrkA, and points to the possibility that Cdk5 may phosphorylate TrkB and TrkC at the Cdk5 consensus sites at the juxtamembrane region (Figure 1A). To examine this possibility, a GST fusion protein containing only the juxtamembrane region of TrkB was prepared.

Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Since BDNF stimulation has been observed to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 in neurons [15], we were interested to delineate if Rho GTPases contribute to BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. To investigate if Rho GTPases are involved, and to identify the Rho GTPase(s) implicated, hippocampal neurons were transfected with WT or DN Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA. We found that while overexpression of WT and DN Rac1 increased the basal number of dendrites in the absence of BDNF treatment, overexpression of both forms of Rac1 abolished BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. On the other hand, while overexpression of DN RhoA slightly enhanced primary dendrites irrespective of BDNF stimulation, overexpression of both WT and DN forms of RhoA inhibited BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Remarkably, in contrast to the inhibition of BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth in cells overexpressing WT Rac1 and RhoA, BDNF stimulation of hippocampal neurons overexpressing WT Cdc42 resulted in an increase in primary dendrites, which was nearly abolished by overexpression of DN Cdc42 (Figure 6A). Our observations therefore suggest that while Rac1 and RhoA may also modulate BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth, it is the activation of Cdc42 following BDNF stimulation that most likely mediates the increase in primary dendrites by BDNF.
0419
In the current study, we demonstrated that Ser478 phosphorylation of TrkB by Cdk5 is essential for the Cdc42-dependent increase in primary dendrites triggered by BDNF, thus adding a new regulatory component to the mechanisms involved in Rho GTPase activation by neurotrophin. Although the precise downstream pathways by which this phosphorylation affects Cdc42 activation remains to be determined, our observations provide some interesting insights.
0006
For immunoprecipitation, 1–2 mg of protein lysates was incubated with 1 μg of the corresponding antibody at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Forty microliters of protein G Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-washed with 1× PBS was added and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After intense washing with the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated protein and its associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
0419
GTPase activity was measured as described [38]. Briefly, cultured cortical neurons at DIV7 were pretreated with DMSO or Ros for 30 min, followed by treatment with BDNF for another 5 min. Cells were lysed at 4 °C and incubated with Pak1-PBD agarose with constant rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The proteins bound to the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer at 4 °C, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed for bound Cdc42 by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against Cdc42 (Upstate Biotechnology). GTPase activity was quantified by densitometry analysis of the blots.

Mounted cells were visualized under fluorescent microscope (Leica, http://www.leica.com).

(B) Cell lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing Cdk5 and TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Cdk5 antibody and immunoblotted with pan-Trk antibody. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were all observed to associate with Cdk5.
0006
(C) Cell lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing p35 and TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and immunoblotted with pan-Trk antibody. TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were all observed to associate with p35.
0006
(F) Brain lysates from P7 p35+/+ or p35−/− mouse brains were immunoprecipitated with p35 and Cdk5 antibodies and immunoblotted with p35, Cdk5, and TrkB antibodies. Rabbit normal IgG served as a control. Association between Cdk5 and TrkB was abolished in p35−/− brain, indicating that p35 was required for the association between Cdk5 and TrkB.
0006
(A) Lysates from COS7 cells overexpressing TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC were immunoprecipitated with pan-Trk antibody and incubated with Cdk5/p25 in an in vitro kinase assay. TrkB and TrkC, but not TrkA, were phosphorylated by Cdk5/p25.
0006
(E) Full-length TrkB WT, M1, M2, and DM were overexpressed with or without Cdk5/p35 in HEK293T cells. In the absence of Cdk5/p35, Ser478-phosphorylated TrkB (p-Ser TrkB) was not detected. Overexpression of Cdk5/p35 resulted in phosphorylation of TrkB WT at Ser478, but phosphorylation at Ser478 was essentially abolished when TrkB M1 and DM were overexpressed. IP, immunoprecipitation.
0006
(A) Cortical neurons were stimulated with BDNF for different time intervals. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with p35 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate. BDNF stimulation for 15 min resulted in a marked increase in Cdk5 activity in cortical neurons. Quantification of the changes in phospho-Histone H1 level following BDNF stimulation was normalized to the value obtained from untreated cultures (time 0) and is shown in the histogram. *, p < 0.05.
0006
(B) Addition of Trk inhibitor K252a abolished BDNF-induced increase in Cdk5 activity. Cortical neurons were pretreated with vehicle control (DMSO) or K252a for 30 min before stimulation with BDNF for 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate. We found that K252a pretreatment markedly reduced the increase in Cdk5 activity triggered by BDNF stimulation, indicating that the induction of Cdk5 activity was dependent on TrkB activation. Quantification of the changes in phospho-Histone H1 level following BDNF stimulation in the presence or absence of K252a treatment was normalized to the value obtained from untreated cultures (time 0) and is shown in the histogram. *, p < 0.05.
0006
(C) Cortical neurons were treated with BDNF for 20 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibody and immunoblotted with TrkB, p35, or Cdk5 antibody. While association between Cdk5 and p35 was not affected by BDNF stimulation, association between p35 and TrkB increased following 20 min of BDNF stimulation.

GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to further characterize this interaction.

Coimmunoprecipitation of BRCA1 and PP1. HEK293T kidney cells were transfected with vectors encoding untagged BRCA1 under the control of a CMV promoter, and vectors encoding Flag-PP1α, β, γ or Flag-Laf4. (A) A western blot probed with BRCA1 shows that immunoprecipitation of protein with an antibody against the Flag-PP1α, β or γ proteins, but not Laf4, co-immunoprecipitates BRCA1 (Lanes 1A-1D). It should be noted that the band observed slightly lower than BRCA1 in lane 1D is a non-specific background band. Lanes 1E-1H show immunoprecipitation of BRCA1 using antibodies against the amino and carboxy termini of BRCA1. (B) A western blot probed with an antibody against the Flag epitope. Lanes 2A-2D indicate immunoprecipitation of the Flag-epitope tagged PP1α, β or γ or Flag-Laf4. Lanes 2E-2G show co-immunoprecipitation of Flag-PP1α, β or γ with antibodies against BRCA1, and lane 2H shows a lack of coimmunoprecipitation of the negative control Flag-Laf4 by BRCA1.
0007
PP1 has 3 isoforms encoded by different genes that are 97% conserved across their catalytic domains and distinct roles for each isoform have yet to be determined. When we coimmunoprecipitated Flag-epitope tagged PP1α, β or γ with BRCA1, we observed that all 3 isoforms interacted with BRCA1. Additionally, we have identified the functional PP1 interacting domain within BRCA1. This domain is found in other PP1 regulatory proteins, suggesting that BRCA1 may regulate the activity of PP1 and could act as a scaffold protein to promote the dephosphorylation of BRCA1 associated proteins by PP1.
0114
The samples were crystallized after removing the tag with thrombin, which generated a four-residue (Gly–Ser–His–Met) peptide N-terminal to the native Asp5 residue.
0104
Consistent with this, our analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) data showed that BAR-PH protein has a higher dimerization affinity in solution (kd=0.34 nM) than BAR domain alone (kd=0.13 μM; Supplementary data).
0419
Interestingly, APPL1 would bind to Rab21 in a GTP-dependent manner (Figure 4), indicating that APPL1 is an effector for both Rab5 and Rab21.
0096
On the other hand, we were unable to detect any binding between APPL1 and Rab22 in the pull-down assay (Figure 4).
0096
To further define the Rab5−APPL1 binding mode, we performed extensive pull-down analyses between variants of Rab5 and APPL1, looking for reversal mutants that could rescue the lost binding ability of others. We identified one such pair; APPL1-N308D abolished the binding to Rab5, while Rab5-L38R had no effect on APPL1 binding. However, Rab5-L38R was found to bind with APPL1-N308D, but not with the other tested APPL1 variants of similar hydrophobic-to-charged mutations, including V25D, A318D, and L321D (Supplementary Figure 6). This result suggests that Rab5-L38R restores binding for APPL1-N308D through complementary, electrostatic, yet specific interactions. It further implies that the position 308 in the β3 strand of APPL1 PH domain is in the vicinity of position 38 in the α1 helix of Rab5 in their complex.
0096
Combined results from our mutagenesis pull-down experiments (Figures 4, 5 and 6), crystal structures of the BAR-PH domain of APPL1 (Figure 1), and structures of GTPase domain of human Rab5 in different nucleotide binding modes (Zhu et al, 2003, 2004) clearly explain the requirement of GTP-bound Rab5 for APPL1 binding. Based on available information, we have modeled the interaction between the two proteins. With the assumption that both proteins remain rigid bodies, our complex model satisfies constraints imposed by the mutagenesis pull-down results (Figure 7).
0419
GTPase binding has emerged as a major function of PH domains in addition to lipid binding (Lemmon, 2004). For example, PH domains in some guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEF) have been shown to bind directly to their cognate small GTPases (Rossman et al, 2002, 2003; Lu et al, 2004), and our data now show direct interaction between the APPL1 PH domain and Rab5. So far, only two crystal structures of small GTPase−PH domain complexes are available. One is Ran−RanBD1 (PDB file 1RRP). The interactions between the Ran GTPase domain and RanBD1 PH core domain is fairly minor, occurring between the switch I region of the GTPase (equivalent to the 40's in Rab5) and strand β2 of the PH domain. This interaction alone is unlikely to be sufficient to form a stable complex. Indeed, Ran has a long C-terminal peptide beside the GTPase domain, while the PH domain of RanBD1 has an extra N-terminal peptide. These two terminal peptides wrap around the partner proteins forming the major interaction between Ran and RanBD1. Such an interaction seems not to be required for Rab5 and APPL1, because the GTPase domain of Rab5 and BAR-PH domain of APPL1 are sufficient to mediate their interaction. The second published small GTPase−PH complex is that of Ral−Exo84 (PDB file 1ZC3). In this complex, the PH domain of Exo84 uses L1, β5, and L6 to interact with the interswitch and switch II regions of Ral forming an intermolecular β-sheet extension mediated by the PH β5 strand and GTPase β2 strand (Jin et al, 2005). Our mutagenesis analysis points to a different surface region (β3, L3, and β4) of the PH domain for Rab5 binding. Therefore, the Rab5−APPL1 interaction represents a new GTPase−PH binding mode.

(B) Subcellular localization of endogenous and exogenous UXT. 293T cells were transfected with (top) or without (bottom) FLAG-UXT. Immunofluorescentmicroscopy was performed with the indicated primary antibodies.
0006
UXT was previously reported to be expressed almost exclusively inside the nucleus of most cells (Markus et al., 2002). This was confirmed in our investigation for either endogenous or overexpressed UXT (Fig. 1 B). To further substantiate its interaction with p65, an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay was applied in which full-length HA-p65 and FLAG-UXT proteins were generated and labeled, respectively, with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation. The products were mixed and immunoprecipitated with either control IgG or anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, UXT could be coprecipitated by antibody against the HA epitope but not by control IgG, which suggests that UXT indeed interacts directly with full-length p65.
0006
To address the physiological relevance of this interaction in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-UXT in 293T cells and then stimulated cells with or without TNF-α for the indicated times. The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively. There was no detectable UXT that interacted with cytoplasmic p65 in the presence or absence of TNF-α (Fig. 1 D), which was consistent with the unique subcellular location of UXT. In addition, there was only a marginal amount of endogenous p65 in the nucleus devoid of TNF-α treatment. Consequently, no UXT was coimmunoprecipitated from this nuclear extract even though there existed a large amount of UXT. In contrast, there exhibited a strong interaction between nuclear p65 and UXT upon TNF-α stimulation. Furthermore, we tested whether endogenous UXT and p65 could interact in response to TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 1 E, endogenous UXT was coimmunoprecipitated by p65 antibody from cells treated with TNF-α. In contrast, UXT was barely detected in the immunoprecipitates without TNF-α treatment. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that only after p65 translocation into the nucleus could UXT have access to p65. However, we could not formally rule out the possibility that posttranslational modifications of either protein were prerequisites for this interaction in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that UXT interacts in vivo with p65 upon TNF-α stimulation.
0402
The ChIP assays were performed in terms of A20, IκBα, or GAPDH promoters using antibodies and corresponding primers as described.
0416
Alternatively, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to support this speculation. Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65. Approximately 90% of control cells displayed p65 inside the nucleus upon stimulation, whereas only 35–50% displayed p65 in the case of the UXT knockdown specimen (Fig. 5 E).
0402
Given that UXT interacted with p65 and was essential to maintain the presence of NF-κB inside the nucleus, we wondered whether UXT was an integral component of the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome in vivo. To address this possibility, we transfected HA-UXT into 293T cells and performed systematic ChIP assays on the promoters of A20 and IκBα as described in Materials and methods. It turned out that UXT was indeed present within the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome. Notably, its presence became much more prominent upon stimulation, which suggested that UXT was dynamically recruited onto the enhanceosome. In addition, UXT had nothing to do with the transcription complex on the GAPDH promoter, indicating the selectivity of UXT action (Fig. 7 A). We also stimulated 293T cells and performed similar ChIP assays to confirm again that endogenous UXT was recruited onto the NF-κB enhanceosome in response to stimulation (Fig. 7 B).
0402
After 10 ng/ml TNF-α stimulation, ChIP assays were performed on A20, IκBα, or GAPDH promoters as described.
0412
Alternatively, we performed supershift assay to further substantiate this observation. Stimulation of 293T cells with TNF-α led to a strong NF-κB DNA-binding band composed of κB probe, NF-κB, and its cofactors in EMSA. Interestingly, this EMSA band was markedly diminished when antibody against UXT was introduced into the reaction mixture (Fig.
0889
For example, p300/CBP played a major role in the acetylation of p65 in vivo (Chen et al., 2002). Conversely, acetylated p65 was subjected to deacetylation by HDAC3 (Chen et al., 2001). Recent work also revealed that SIRT1 physically interacted with p65 and promoted p65 deacetylation (Yeung et al., 2004).
0019
In vitro precipitation experiments demonstrated that COΔB-box was co-immunoprecipitated with GAD:COP1, whereas COΔCCT was not. Therefore, the N-terminal region containing the B-boxes is not required for interaction with COP1, suggesting that the interaction with COP1 is mediated by the C-terminal region of CO that contains the CCT domain.
0402
ChIP suggests that DDX3X can be recruited to the IFN promoter, positioning DDX3X downstream of TBK1 at the level of IRF3.
0416
Consistent with these data, S329/T331-phosphorylated MDC1 was detected by immunofluorescence in both control and γ-irradiated cells (Fig 2B; note the absence of staining in cells treated with MDC1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)), confirming that SDTD-phosphorylated MDC1 is present in the absence of damage and also forms IRIF.
0096
Next, we used the recombinant, purified MRN complex in peptide pull-down experiments. These showed that MRN bound to the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated form of the SDTD peptide—confirming the direct nature of the interaction—yet did not bind to either version of the H2AX C-terminal peptide (Fig 3A). This indicates the specificity of MRN for the phosphorylated MDC1 SDTD motif and also shows that if, as previously reported, NBS1 binds to γH2AX directly (Kobayashi et al, 2002), this interaction must be less stable than MRN binding to the phosphorylated SDTD motif.
0019
The wild-type MDC1 derivative efficiently co-immunoprecipitated MRN at physiological salt concentrations, whereas only low levels of MRN were recovered in immunoprecipitates of the MDC1SDTDΔ mutant (Fig 4B), consistent with the SDTD region being the principal MRN interaction interface.

(B) A 200 ng portion of CK2-phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated GST-SDTD6 was incubated in pull-down reactions with 25 μl of in vitro-translated (IVT) HA fusions corresponding to amino-acid residues 1–348 of NBS1 (HA-fNBS1), or analogous proteins bearing point mutations predicted to abolish either FHA (R28A/H45A) or BRCT2 (K160M) phosphorylation-dependent interactions.
0096
GST-hnRNP-K and GST proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 cells, previously transformed with vector pGEX-RNP-K or pGEX-4T. Cells were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested and suspended in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, and anti-proteases), and sonicated on ice. GST-hnRNP-K and GST alone were purified from cleared lysates by mixing with glutathione-sepharose 4B beads (GE HealthCare), 5 ml of cleared lysate/400 μl of beads, for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, GST-hnRNP-K or GST beads were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, ph 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical)) at 4 °C for 1 h with insect cell extracts containing either p30 or p54 ASFV proteins overexpressed in a baculovirus system [8]. Equal amounts of GST, GST-hnRNP-K and ASFV proteins p30 and p54 were used as judged by Coomasie Blue staining.
0416
To ascertain the time in infection and the subcellular compartment at which the interaction occurs, ASFV infected cells were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy at different times post infection (at least 30 infected cells were analyzed for each time point at 0, 6, 8 and 12 hpi).
0096
This interaction was further confirmed by an in vitro GST-fusion pull-down assay, using either p30 obtained from baculovirus system or ASFV infected cell extracts.
0416
Colocalization of p30 and hnRNP-K in the nucleus of infected cells. Cells were infected with BA71V strain and analyzed at different times post infection by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy acquiring 0.1 μm optical sections from the Z-axis. A representative image of an infected cell at 8 hpi is shown (A). p30 was detected with a monoclonal anti-p30 followed by Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (red) and hnRNP-K with an anti-hnRNP-K specific serum followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (green). Discrete spots of colocalization of both proteins (orange) can be discerned in the cell nucleus.
0402
Cells were cultured for 24h and prepared using a ChIP assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and preformed as previously describe 28. Primers for the FOXO3a and SCO2 promoter are shown (Supplemental Methods) and their location is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. IP and transient transfection IP westerns were done as previously described 28. Bands for all IPs were detected using an ECL protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized with Fuji Las-3000 intelligent darkbox (FujiFilm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT).
0006
We sought to establish whether the mitochondrial localized SIRT3 may also form a physical interaction with the FOXO family protein, FOXO3a, using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) SIRT3 expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody.
0402
ChIP analysis showed that wt-SIRT3 cells have an increase in FOXO3a binding to upstream regulatory regions of gene promoters that each contain two canonical FOXO3a binding sites roughly 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (supplemental Fig. S3). FOXO3a binding to both the MnSOD (Fig.3D, upper panel) and SCO2 (lower panel) promoters is increased in the wt-SIRT3, as compared to mt-SIRT3 cells. These experiments imply that SIRT3 may increase FOXO3a DNA-binding.
0006
(A) FOXO3a binds to SIRT3 in vitro. Cos-7 cells were transfected with either SIRT3 wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt) or deacetylation mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) vectors and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IPd) with an anti-Myc antibody followed by Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody. (B) HCT116 cell lysates were IPd with either an anti-FOXO3a or anti-SIRT3 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-FOXO3a antibody. (C) Mitochondrial factions from HCT116 cells were IPd with either an anti-FOXO3a or anti-SIRT3 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-FOXO3a antibody.

Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde to crosslink protein-DNA interactions, sonicated, and fixed cells were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-FOXO3a antibody.

Kelch motifs, structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein kelch, allow protein folding into a cylindrical ‘β-propeller structure’ (Adams et al., 2000) forming a potential protein–protein interaction domain (Andrade et al., 2001).
0007
Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions. Subsequently, localization of ACBP4 and its interacting protein, AtEBP, was confirmed using transient expression of GFP- and DsRed-tagged fusion proteins in Nicotiana tabacum.
