0019
These plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells and the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. Immunoblotting of the precipitates using anti-HA antibodies indicated that Flag-Bcl-GL was co-precipitated with HA-WT-MELK (Figure 3c).

0019
To further determine which segment of Bcl-GL can interact with WT-MELK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses using HA-WT-MELK and partial Bcl-GL proteins tagged with Flag (Figure 3e). After co-transfection of plasmid clones into HeLa cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, and then immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody.
0007
To investigate this hypothesis, we transiently co-transfected two plasmid clones designed to express HA-tagged MELK (WT or D150A) and Flag-tagged Bcl-GL into COS7 cells, and then performed a TUNEL assay and FACS analysis to measure the proportions of apoptotic cells (see Material and methods).

We hypothesized that, although BRCA1 was shown to interact with PP1β in the two-hybrid screen, it might be capable of interacting with all three PP1 isoforms PP1 due to their high degree of sequence similarity.

We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N-terminal BAR-PH domain motif.
0114
In order to address the functional roles of the BAR-PH motif in APPL1 and related proteins, we have carried out structure-function studies on human APPL1 and determined the crystal structures of the Rab5-binding region of APPL1 as well as the BAR domain alone.
0114
In each of the two crystal forms, two BAR molecules form a tightly packed dimer, which assumes a crescent-like shape, a hallmark of the BAR dimer structure (Figure 1).
0114
The canonical ligand-binding site is composed of β1, L1, β2, L3, and L6 (exemplified in the crystal structure of PLC-δ1, PDB file 1MAI) and, roughly speaking, is confined to a triangular area with L1, L3, and L6 as the three vertices.
0114
In our crystal structure of the APPL1 BAR-PH dimer, the two PH domains are located at the opposite ends of the crescent-shaped dimer, and each has fairly extensive contact with the BAR domain of its symmetry mate (Figure 1).
0114
Because of the interaction between D15SPxxR20 motif and PH domain, the rest N-terminus peptide (residues 5−12) clearly became ordered in the BAR-PH crystal structure, in comparison to the BAR domain-alone crystal structure, where residues N-terminal to Leu13 were invisible in the electron density map. The fixed N-terminal peptide in the BAR-PH structure has an extended backbone conformation between Met4 (remnant from the His-tag cleavage) and Pro8, followed by a one-turn 310 helix (Figure 3C).

0114
Furthermore, the N-terminus is surrounded by a number of regions from the dimer partner, including the helix α4 and flexible loop connecting α1 and α2 (where residues 76−78 were mobile in the crystal structure).
0096
To identify Rab5-binding site(s) in APPL1, GST−Rab5-Q79L (full length) was used to pull down APPL1 variants having surface point mutations.

0276
The WT APPL1 (5−419) fragment was used as the parental construct for the mutagenesis, because this fragment is easily distinguishable from GST−Rab5 by size on SDS–PAGE gels without the need for Western blot analysis.
0114
Interaction between small GTPase and BAR domain has been exemplified in a complex crystal structure of Rac and arfaptin2 before (Tarricone et al, 2001).
0114
Consistent with our previous structural studies on Rab5–rabaptin5 interaction (Zhu et al, 2004), all mutations within the 38−50 region did not interfere with Rab5−rabaptin5 binding (Figure 6A). Furthermore, with the knowledge of crystal structures of Rab5–rabaptin5 and Rab22–rabenosyn5 complexes, it is clear that both Rab5 effectors rabaptin5 and rabenosyn5 bind to the so called invariant hydrophobic triad of Rab5 (i.e., Phe57, Trp74, and Tyr89) (Merithew et al, 2001).
0114
Combined results from our mutagenesis pull-down experiments (Figures 4, 5 and 6), crystal structures of the BAR-PH domain of APPL1 (Figure 1), and structures of GTPase domain of human Rab5 in different nucleotide binding modes (Zhu et al, 2003, 2004) clearly explain the requirement of GTP-bound Rab5 for APPL1 binding.

0114
Note that the L3-β4 region showed weak electron density in the crystal structure, indicating its higher mobility and possible adaptability in forming a complex with Rab5.
0114
In contrast to the α-helix dominant Rab-binding motifs of all other effectors of known 3D structures (Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999; Zhu et al, 2004; Eathiraj et al, 2005; Wu et al, 2005; Wei et al, 2006), the Rab5-binding motif of APPL1 is mainly composed of two β-strands, β3 and β4, and their connecting loop L3. Although the exact binding position on the Rab protein and orientation of the effector helices may differ among available complex structures, all these Rab-binding domains interact with the invariant hydrophobic triad.
0114
So far, only two crystal structures of small GTPase−PH domain complexes are available.
0114
Thus, we propose that all BAR-PH containing proteins share similar 3D structures in the corresponding regions and that the BAR-PH motif may function as a general structural unit to interact with membrane-bound proteins and other molecular moieties.
0114
A similar N-BAR structure was predicted for APPL1 and APPL2 (Habermann, 2004), but our current APPL1 crystal structure does not show such a structural motif.
0004
After further purification with Resource-QTM anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare), both protein samples were concentrated to ∼30 mg ml−1 in (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (βME)) and stored at −85°C until needed.
0276
Analyzing the crystal content by SDS–PAGE confirmed the integrity of the protein sample.
0114
Coordinates and the structural factors of the APPL1 crystal structures have been deposited to PDB under codes 2Q12 (BAR domain structure) and 2Q13 (BAR-PH domain structure).

0114
We have determined the crystal structure of full-length ST in complex with PP2A A subunit at 3.1 Å resolution. ST consists of an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain that contains two zinc-binding motifs.
0114
PP2A is a family of heterotrimeric enzymes, composed of a structural A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits. Here we have determined the structure of SV40 ST in complex with the PP2A structural subunit Aα. SV40 ST consists of an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain that contains two separate zinc-binding motifs.
0114
The crystal structure of full-length SV40 small t antigen (ST) in complex with the A subunit of its target, protein phosphatase 2A, contributes to our understanding of the oncogenic functions of ST.
0114
While the structure of the J domain can be predicted from prior structural determinations of LT, the overall structure of ST remains to be unraveled and it is unclear how ST may interact with PP2A and regulate PP2A activities.
0114
SV40 ST exhibits an all α-helix structure with two zinc-binding sites in the unique domain (Figure 2A). The J domain contains three helices and has a structure similar to the previously solved crystal structure of the J domain of SV40 LT and a NMR structure of polyomavirus DnaJ-like domain [41,42], with Cα root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.84 and 1.83 Å, respectively.

0077
The J domain contains three helices and has a structure similar to the previously solved crystal structure of the J domain of SV40 LT and a NMR structure of polyomavirus DnaJ-like domain [41,42], with Cα root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.84 and 1.83 Å, respectively.
0114
These two zinc-binding motifs are completely distinct from the previously proposed GAL4-type zinc cluster for ST and are also different from classical zinc finger structures [33,34,43].
0114
The A-ST interface and the structure of HEAT repeats 2–10 of the A subunit are quite rigid, since these structures can be well superimposed in all four A-ST complexes in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, HEAT repeats 11–15 apparently have highly variable structures, and the first HEAT repeat is not well folded in some cases (Figure 6A and 6B).
0114
PP2A A subunit structures were aligned based on their structures of HEAT repeats 2–10. PP2A A subunit structures that used for the alignment are from the four A-ST complexes in the asymmetric unit, the A subunit structure alone (PDB code: 1B3U), the AC dimer structure (PDB code: 2IE3), and the A-B56-C trimeric structure (PDB code: 2IAE). The HEAT repeats 2–10 may form a rigid structural block since no significant structural variations were observed for this region among all A subunit structures.
0114
These observations provide strong support to the A-ST interface observed in our crystal structure.
0004
Consistent with prior reports [23,24], we failed to observe stable direct interaction between purified ST and PP2A C subunit using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay (unpublished data).
0114
In summary, our structural and biochemical studies reveal the structure of the ST family and define the interaction between ST and the A subunit of PP2A.
0071
Soluble fractions were filtered with 0.8 μm syringe filters and applied into a Ni-NTA affinity column pre-equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol.

0096

0019

10% of the input proteins for pull down are shown at the left.

To further substantiate its interaction with p65, an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay was applied in which full-length HA-p65 and FLAG-UXT proteins were generated and labeled, respectively, with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation. The products were mixed and immunoprecipitated with either control IgG or anti-HA antibody.
0019
The fractionated cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 antibody or IgG as a control, respectively.
0019
To substantiate this finding, we took advantage of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to examine whether binding of NF-κB to its endogenous promoter was influenced in vivo when the expression of UXT was diminished.
0413
This suggested that UXT positively regulated p65 inside the nucleus, and the loss of it affected the sustained action of p65 in the nucleus, which led to the attenuated EMSA results as observed in Fig.
0413
This rescuing effect was also confirmed with EMSA assays (Fig.
0413
Nuclear lysates were used for EMSA to check endogenous NF-κB or sp1 DNA binding activities.
0413
Stimulation of 293T cells with TNF-α led to a strong NF-κB DNA-binding band composed of κB probe, NF-κB, and its cofactors in EMSA. Interestingly, this EMSA band was markedly diminished when antibody against UXT was introduced into the reaction mixture (Fig.
0413
However, immunofluorescence and EMSA experiments indicated that the knockdown of CARM1 did not affect the nuclear presence of p65 (Fig.
0413
(B) 10 μg of nuclear extracts from LNCaP or PC-3 were subjected to EMSA with a radiolabeled κB or sp1 probe.

0413
Endogenous NF-κB or sp1 DNA binding activities were examined by EMSA.
0413
(2) ChIP and EMSA assays demonstrated that UXT localized inside the NF-κB enhanceosome in vivo and was recruited to it upon stimulation.
0402
Furthermore, they were implicated to directly regulate transcription factors. For example, a nuclear chaperone termed FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) could facilitate transcript elongation through nucleosomes (Orphanides et al., 1998).
0018
A cDNA fragment encoding residues 1–312 of human p65 was inserted in frame into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBKT7. A human thymus cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was screened according to protocols recommended by the manufacturer.
0055
The method used to analyse FRET is described in detail in Supplementary data.
0276
Supernatant fractions and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS–PAGE and visualized by autoradiography using a phosphorimager.
0019
Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that DDX3X is recruited to the IFN promoter upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism of action.
0402
Immunoprecipitation experiments using tagged TBK1 suggested that its interaction with DDX3X and the transcription factor IRF3 are significantly weaker than the interaction between TBK1 and TANK and therefore not detected by coimmunoprecipitation under stringent conditions (Supplementary Figure 1A).
0019
To address this question, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and amplified the enhanceosome-binding region of the IFN-β promoter by quantitative PCR (Figure 5A).

0004
GS-TAP-tagged DDX3X, isolated by affinity purification using rabbit IgG agarose, was also recruited to the enhanceosome region upon L.
0276
We observed that coexpression of TBK1 with DDX3X is associated with a slight shift in DDX3X migration on an SDS–PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1).
0004
To rule out any indirect effect, we expressed His-tagged IRF3, DDX3X and Grb2 in Escherichia coli and purified them by HisTrap chromatography. Equal amounts of purified proteins were then used for an in vitro kinase assay using TBK1 purified from HEK293 cells.

The reaction was terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer after 5–15 min. Samples were separated by SDS–PAGE, the gels were dried and analysed by autoradiography.

0096
Consistent with this, a bacterially expressed protein (glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SDTD2) encompassing two MDC1 SDTD motifs (contained within amino-acid residues 296–340 of MDC1) was efficiently phosphorylated by recombinant CK2 in vitro, as shown by a marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility and detection by anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum (Fig 2C, upper and lower panels, respectively).

0413
Immunoblotting showed that treating these cells with the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-benzimidazole increased the electrophoretic mobility of the MDC1 SDTD fragment and reduced the ability of the fragment to co-immunoprecipitate MRN (Fig 2E).

GST-hnRNP-K and GST alone were purified from cleared lysates by mixing with glutathione-sepharose 4B beads (GE HealthCare), 5 ml of cleared lysate/400 μl of beads, for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, GST-hnRNP-K or GST beads were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, ph 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical)) at 4 °C for 1 h with insect cell extracts containing either p30 or p54 ASFV proteins overexpressed in a baculovirus system [8]. Equal amounts of GST, GST-hnRNP-K and ASFV proteins p30 and p54 were used as judged by Coomasie Blue staining.

To ascertain the time in infection and the subcellular compartment at which the interaction occurs, ASFV infected cells were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy at different times post infection (at least 30 infected cells were analyzed for each time point at 0, 6, 8 and 12 hpi).
0416
Nevertheless, colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm during infection was not detectable by immunofluorescence, probably because of the low relative abundance of hnRNP-K in cytoplasm and its shuttling properties which difficult its visualization by immunofluorescence microscopy.

We sought to establish whether the mitochondrial localized SIRT3 may also form a physical interaction with the FOXO family protein, FOXO3a, using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) SIRT3 expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody. Western analysis with an anti-FOXO3a antibody subsequently showed a physical interaction between both wild-type and mutant SIRT3 with FOXO3a (Fig.

The subcellular localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion. Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis.

Immuno-electron microscopy on Arabidopsis sections not only localized ACBP4 to the cytosol but also to the periphery of the nucleus upon closer examination, perhaps as a result of its interaction with AtEBP.

The role of its kelch motifs in mediating protein–protein interactions is investigated here because the identification of its interactors will provide a better understanding of ACBP4 function in planta. Kelch motifs, structural repeats first observed in the Drosophila actin cross-linking protein kelch, allow protein folding into a cylindrical ‘β-propeller structure’ (Adams et al., 2000) forming a potential protein–protein interaction domain (Andrade et al., 2001).

0019
Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein–protein interactions.
0018
Of these, positive yeast clones were tested for interaction by selection on histidine drop-out and β-galactosidase assays.
0018
To corroborate the interaction from yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed according to Mongiat et al.

The HindIII-SacI fragment from pBI-771 carrying GAL4(TA) (amino acids 768–881) was cloned into corresponding restriction sites on pKS. The GAL4(TA)-ACBP4 fusion construct was prepared by inserting ACBP4 cDNA from pAT181, on a 2 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment, into the EcoRI-BglII sites of pKS-TA with the 5′ of TA-ACBP4 adjacent to the T3 promoter.
0018
Two putative interactors, ADF3 (identified at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison) and AtEBP (from a yeast two-hybrid screen in our laboratory) were selected for further studies.

Total proteins were separated on SDS–PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-C membranes (Amersham).

However, this was not investigated further in this study because it did not bind ACBP4 in subsequent co-immunoprecipitation, possibly due to the absence of some as yet unidentified essential cofactor(s) for binding in an in vitro co-immunoprecipitation reaction.

When Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened for interacting proteins of Arabidopsis ACBPs by the yeast two-hybrid system in our laboratory, as well as at the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin–Madison, while we could not identify protein interactors for ACBP5, a common interacting protein (AtEBP) was identified for both ACBP2 (Li and Chye, 2004) and ACBP4.
