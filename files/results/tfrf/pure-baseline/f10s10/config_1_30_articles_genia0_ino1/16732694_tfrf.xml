This process involves a series of steps that include docking of synaptic vesicles to specialized sites of the plasma membrane known as active zones, a priming reaction(s) that leaves the vesicles in a release-ready state, and the actual release of neurotransmitters triggered by Ca2+ influx. These steps are controlled by a complex protein machinery that contains components that have homologs in most types of intracellular membrane fusion such as the SNARE proteins syntaxin, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) homolog Munc18–1, and the Rab3 small GTPases, as well as specialized proteins such as synaptotagmin 1, complexins, Munc13s, and α-RIMs (reviewed in [1]). Although the mechanism of release is still unclear, clues to this mechanism have emerged from the three-dimensional structures of several complexes of these proteins (reviewed in [2]). However, much less is known about protein–protein interactions that couple the basic steps of exocytosis to the regulation of release during presynaptic plasticity processes, which are of critical importance to shape the properties of neural networks and are thought to mediate some forms of information processing in the brain [3].</text><annotation id="3"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="2145" length="573"/><text>These steps are controlled by a complex protein machinery that contains components that have homologs in most types of intracellular membrane fusion such as the SNARE proteins syntaxin, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) homolog Munc18–1, and the Rab3 small GTPases, as well as specialized proteins such as synaptotagmin 1, complexins, Munc13s, and α-RIMs (reviewed in [1]).

Munc13 proteins play a crucial role in synaptic vesicle priming, as shown by the severe disruption of neurotransmitter release caused byunc13 mutations in invertebrates [4,5], and by the total abrogation of spontaneous, Ca2+-evoked and hypertonic sucrose–induced release observed in double knockout mice lacking Munc13–1 and the closely related isoform Munc13–2 [6]. This crucial role in vesicle priming is associated with the C-terminal MUN domain (Figure 1A), which is sufficient to rescue release in the Munc13–1/2 double knockout mice [7]. Other Munc13–1 sequences mediate different presynaptic plasticity processes. Thus, the Munc13–1 C1 domain is responsible for diacylglycerol-dependent augmentation of release [8], whereas a calmodulin-binding sequence is involved in Ca2+-dependent short-term plasticity [9] (seeFigure 1A). Moreover, the N-terminal region of Munc13–1 binds to α-RIMs [10], which are large (ca. 180 kDa) Rab3 effectors that are localized at active zones and include two closely related isoforms, RIM1α and RIM2α [11,12]. α-RIMs are also required for normal synaptic vesicle priming, and participate in different forms of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity [13–17]. These forms include mossy-fiber long-term potentiation (LTP), which likely involves a RIM1α/Rab3A interaction as this form of plasticity is abolished in the absence of either RIM1α or Rab3A [15,18]. The severe defects in memory and learning observed in RIM1α knockout mice [19] underline the critical importance of these functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4890</offset><text>The physiological significance of Munc13–1/α-RIM binding has been demonstrated by the impairment of vesicle priming observed upon interference with this interaction [10,20], and by the observation of a 60% decrease in Munc13–1 levels in RIM1α knockout mice [14]. The Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction requires the C2A domain of Munc13–1 and the zinc finger (ZF) domain of α-RIMs [20], which is adjacent to the α-helical sequences involved in Rab3 binding (seeFigure 1A). This architecture allows formation of a tripartite Rab3/RIM/Munc13–1 complex [20]. Hence, in addition to being important for normal synaptic vesicle priming, Munc13–1/α-RIM binding is likely to couple priming to mossy-fiber LTP and perhaps to other forms of RIM-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the lack of structural information at atomic resolution about this interaction hinders investigation of this hypothesis and elucidation of the coupling mechanism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5877</offset><text>Characterizing the Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction is also of general interest for our overall understanding of protein–protein interactions because it involves two different types of widespread protein modules, namely a C2 domain and a ZF domain. Whereas it was initially thought that these and other ubiquitous modules (e.g., PDZ, SH2, and SH3 domains) each perform a particular type of activity, it is now clear that many of these modules can participate in diverse interactions. Thus, C2 domains perform a variety of functions that often depend on their most common activity, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, but they are also believed to act as protein–protein interaction modules (reviewed in [21]). Although the mechanisms of Ca2+/phospholipid binding to C2 domains have been extensively characterized [22–24], no high-resolution structures of protein complexes involving C2 domains have been described. Similarly, ZF domains exhibit a great functional diversity and have been implicated in multiple protein–protein interactions, but only limited high-resolution information about these interactions is available (reviewed in [25]). Hence, understanding the interaction between the Munc13–1 C2A domain and the α-RIM ZF domain at atomic detail can provide key insights into the functional diversification of C2 domains and ZF domains in general.</text><annotation id="6"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0413</infon><location offset="6120" length="461"/><text>Whereas it was initially thought that these and other ubiquitous modules (e.g., PDZ, SH2, and SH3 domains) each perform a particular type of activity, it is now clear that many of these modules can participate in diverse interactions.

Correspondingly, initial screens yielded no crystals for Munc13–13–150 and Munc13–13–209, and extensive screens with Munc13–13–132 only led to needle-like crystal clusters that were not suitable for structure determination (Figure S1).

This fragment readily yielded crystals under 20 different conditions of a basic crystallization screen (Index screen, Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California, United States). After condition optimization, we obtained high-quality crystals (Figure S1) that allowed us to solve the crystal structure of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer at 1.44 Å resolution using molecular replacement.Table 1 describes the structural statistics andFigure 2A shows a representative portion of the electron density.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14495</offset><text>The asymmetric unit of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain crystals contains four monomers (referred to as monomers A–D).

These surfaces pack in an antiparallel orientation, twisting around each other to maximize intermolecular contacts (Figure 2B and2E). This twisted nature of the interface arises from the formation of an eight-stranded β-barrel–like structure by the concave β-sheets of the two monomers, which form intermolecular hydrogen bonds through strands 3 and 6 (Figure 2B and2F). In addition to these strand–strand interactions, the interface between the two monomers involves multiple hydrophobic, ionic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions between side chains of both monomers, which are made possible by the complementarity of the hydrophobic and electrostatic properties of the side chains from both monomers that pack against each other (Figure 2G). Particularly prominent are interactions involving the K32 side chain, which makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with the W65 aromatic ring, forms a hydrogen bond with the Y23 OH group, and interacts electrostatically with the E63 and D72 side chains. Most of the side chains that form the interface between the two monomers are highly conserved through evolution (Figure 3), suggesting that the ability of the Munc13–1 C2A domain to homodimerize is shared in a wide variety of species.</text><annotation id="29"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="17845" length="234"/><text>Most of the side chains that form the interface between the two monomers are highly conserved through evolution (Figure 3), suggesting that the ability of the Munc13–1 C2A domain to homodimerize is shared in a wide variety of species.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18152</offset><text>The two monomers of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain dimer are largely related by a C2 symmetry axis that runs through the center of the β-barrel, but this symmetry is broken by the unusual β-hairpin of monomer C because the same sequence is partially disordered in monomer A (Figure 2B). The β-hairpin from monomer C appears to form a lid over the β-barrel (Figure 2B,2F, and2G), but its surface is separated from the surface of monomer A by a layer of ordered water molecules and hence does not establish direct intermonomer contacts. However, this β-hairpin is well packed against strand 6 of monomer C itself and appears to be an intrinsic feature of the Munc13–1 C2A domain, because the two Munc13–1 monomers present in the crystal structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2 heterodimer also contain this β-hairpin (see below). The observation of this β-hairpin in only one monomer of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer likely arises from steric clashes that would occur if this β-hairpin were formed in both monomers. Interestingly, the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–128 (Figure S1) contains only about 100 backbone cross-peaks. This cross-peak count indicates a symmetry between the two monomers in solution, whereas the absence of approximately 20 cross-peaks in the spectrum suggests that both monomers may alternate in forming the β-hairpin, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium that broadens the cross-peaks from the amide groups of this region.</text><annotation id="30"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="18680" length="283"/><text>However, this β-hairpin is well packed against strand 6 of monomer C itself and appears to be an intrinsic feature of the Munc13–1 C2A domain, because the two Munc13–1 monomers present in the crystal structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2 heterodimer also contain this β-hairpin (see below).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>19691</offset><text>Crystallization of a Munc13–1/RIM2α ZF Domain Heterodimer</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19752</offset><text>Munc13–13–150 is the minimal Munc13–1 fragment for tight binding to the RIM2α ZF domain (apparent Kd 0.35 μM); further C-terminal extension to residue 209 provides a moderate increase in binding energy (1.17 kcal/mol based on an apparent Kd of 0.07 μM for the Munc13–13–209 complex) [20].

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the ability of Munc13–13–150(K32E) to bind to RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4B), yielding an apparent Kd of 0.10 μM and a 1:1 stoichiometry. We attribute this increased apparent affinity compared to the wild-type complex to the lack of competition with homodimerization. The high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of isolated15N-labeled Munc13–13–150(K32E) (Figure 4C, black contours) confirmed its monomeric nature even at 100 μM concentration. Binding to RIM2α82–142 induced shifts in numerous cross-peaks of Munc13–13–150(K32E) (Figure 4C, red contours), and several new, well-resolved cross-peaks emerged at the edges of the spectrum (circled in blue inFigure 4C). These cross-peaks likely arise from the C-terminal extension of the C2A domain (residues 129–150), which may be partially unstructured in isolated Munc13–13–150(K32E), but is expected to become structured upon binding to the RIM2α82–142.

Importantly, the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex readily yielded crystals in more than one third of the conditions of a basic crystallization screen (Index screen, Hampton Research) (Figure S3), whereas crystallization trials with the Munc13–13–209(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex failed, as expected from the lack of a defined structure in most of the 151–209 sequence (see above).</text><annotation id="32"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0104</infon><location offset="21274" length="203"/><text>Gel filtration showed that both point mutations disrupt dimerization of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209, but preserve heterodimerization with RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4A and unpublished data).</text></annotation><annotation id="33"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0071</infon><location offset="21274" length="203"/><text>Gel filtration showed that both point mutations disrupt dimerization of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209, but preserve heterodimerization with RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4A and unpublished data).</text></annotation><annotation id="34"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0065</infon><location offset="21478" length="179"/><text>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the ability of Munc13–13–150(K32E) to bind to RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4B), yielding an apparent Kd of 0.10 μM and a 1:1 stoichiometry.</text></annotation><annotation id="35"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0676</infon><location offset="21658" length="129"/><text>We attribute this increased apparent affinity compared to the wild-type complex to the lack of competition with homodimerization.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23412</offset><text>Crystal Structure of the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α ZF Domain Complex</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23497</offset><text>Condition optimization allowed us to determine the structure of the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex at 1.78 Å resolution using molecular replacement (Figures 5 and6). The structural statistics are described inTable 1, and a representative region of the electron density is shown inFigure 5A. Surprisingly, the asymmetric unit of the crystals contained two molecules of Munc13–13–150(K32E) (referred to as monomers A and B) and one of RIM2α82–142 (Figure 5B). A superposition of the two Munc13–13–150(K32E) monomers (Figure 5C) shows that their C2A domains are structurally very similar and include the unusual β-hairpin observed in one of the monomers of the C2A-domain homodimer (see above). The C-terminal extension of both Munc13–13–150(K32E) monomers (residues 129–150) forms an α-helix that is connected to the C2A domain by a linker region. In monomer B (Figure 5B and5C, green), this α-helix does not contact RIM2α82–142 and instead packs against its own C2A domain and a crystallographic symmetry mate of monomer A. In contrast, in monomer A (Figures 5B,5C, and6A, orange), the linker region is extended, allowing interactions of the C2A domain and the α-helix with opposite sites of the ZF domain. This binding mode nicely explains the requirement of both the C2A domain and the C-terminal extension of Munc13–1 for binding to RIM2α82–142. In addition, the K97 and K99 side chains of RIM2α82–142, which were shown to be critical for Munc13–1 binding [20], contact monomer A of Munc13–13–150(K32E) (see below), but not monomer B. Thus, the binding mode between monomer A and RIM2α82–142 observed in the crystals is consistent with all available data obtained in solution, whereas that involving monomer B is not. Moreover, the gel filtration and ITC data (Figure 4A and4B), as well as the high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex and the observation of only one set of cross-peaks (Figure 4C), demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry. All these results strongly suggest that the monomer A/RIM2α82–142 complex observed in the crystals faithfully reflects the true Munc13–1/RIM2α binding mode, whereas the presence of a second Munc13–13–150(K32E) molecule in the crystals must be considered a consequence of crystal packing.</text><annotation id="36"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0676</infon><location offset="23497" length="174"/><text>Condition optimization allowed us to determine the structure of the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex at 1.78 Å resolution using molecular replacement (Figures 5 and6).</text></annotation><annotation id="37"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0104</infon><location offset="25043" length="182"/><text>Thus, the binding mode between monomer A and RIM2α82–142 observed in the crystals is consistent with all available data obtained in solution, whereas that involving monomer B is not.</text></annotation><annotation id="38"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0065</infon><location offset="25226" length="255"/><text>Moreover, the gel filtration and ITC data (Figure 4A and4B), as well as the high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex and the observation of only one set of cross-peaks (Figure 4C), demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry.</text></annotation><annotation id="39"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0071</infon><location offset="25226" length="255"/><text>Moreover, the gel filtration and ITC data (Figure 4A and4B), as well as the high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex and the observation of only one set of cross-peaks (Figure 4C), demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26077</offset><text>Superposition of monomer C of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer with monomer A of Munc13–13–150(K32E) from the heterodimer (Figure 5D) yielded an rms deviation of 0.52 Å for 127 Cα carbons, showing that binding to RIM2α82–142 does not involve large conformational changes in the C2A domain.

All these observations lead to the model of Figure 7C, which proposes that formation of the Munc13–1/RIM/Rab3A tripartite complex requires disruption of the Munc13–1 homodimer and a change in the relative orientation of the structural elements of RIM.</text><annotation id="46"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="31209" length="348"/><text>Our Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 structure, together with the crystal structure of a rabphilin/Rab3A complex [27], and the sequence homology between rabphilin and RIM2α, also provide an explanation for our previous observations that Munc13–1, RIM2α, and Rab3A form a tripartite complex and that Munc13–1 alters the RIM2α/Rab3A binding mode [20].</text></annotation><annotation id="47"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0077</infon><location offset="31558" length="281"/><text>Thus, NMR studies showed that a long α-helix (helix a1) and an SGAWFY motif at the end of the short α-helix at the C-terminus of the RIM2α ZF domain (helix a2) bind to Rab3A, and that the interaction involving the SGAWFY motif is released upon binding of Munc13–1 to the ZF domain.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>32316</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32327</offset><text>Neurotransmitter release constitutes a fundamental means for interneuronal communication and requires tight temporal and spatial regulation. In addition, changes in the efficiency of release in presynaptic plasticity processes are crucial for some forms of information processing in the brain, and presumably arise from modulatory effects on the different steps that lead to release. Although abundant structural information has been obtained for some of the central components of the membrane fusion machinery, little is known about the protein–protein interactions that mediate synaptic vesicle priming and/or couple this key step to presynaptic plasticity processes. The Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction is particularly interesting in this regard since its physiological importance has been demonstrated and both Munc13–1 and α-RIMs are involved in priming and plasticity. Here we uncover a novel interaction that is likely to participate in this coupling, i.e., Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimerization, and describe the three-dimensional structures of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer and a Munc13–1/α-RIM heterodimer, revealing at atomic resolution an unexpected versatility of C2 domains as protein–protein interaction modules. Our results illustrate the power of combining X-ray crystallography with NMR spectroscopy to study structural aspects of protein complexes, and suggest that a complex cascade of protein–protein interactions, including a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/α-RIM heterodimer switch, may regulate synaptic vesicle priming and some forms of presynaptic plasticity.</text><annotation id="48"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="33553" length="353"/><text>Our results illustrate the power of combining X-ray crystallography with NMR spectroscopy to study structural aspects of protein complexes, and suggest that a complex cascade of protein–protein interactions, including a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/α-RIM heterodimer switch, may regulate synaptic vesicle priming and some forms of presynaptic plasticity.</text></annotation><annotation id="49"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0077</infon><location offset="33553" length="353"/><text>Our results illustrate the power of combining X-ray crystallography with NMR spectroscopy to study structural aspects of protein complexes, and suggest that a complex cascade of protein–protein interactions, including a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/α-RIM heterodimer switch, may regulate synaptic vesicle priming and some forms of presynaptic plasticity.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>33952</offset><text>Biological Implications</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33976</offset><text>Munc13s are essential for synaptic vesicle priming [6], and this activity resides in their MUN domain [7]. At least some of the remaining Munc13 sequences are likely to modulate priming and/or plasticity by regulating MUN domain activity. Disrupting the interaction between the N-terminal region of Munc13–1 and α-RIMs causes a severe impairment in priming [10,20] that is comparable to that observed in RIM1α knockout mice [16]. The marked decrease in Munc13–1 levels observed in these mice further supports the physiological importance of the Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction [14]. These observations, together with the proposed role of α-RIMs in organizing active zones [14], suggest that binding of the Munc13–1 N-terminus to the α-RIM ZF domain may help localize Munc13–1 at the active zone to perform its priming function. Since the Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction competes with Munc13–1 homodimerization, this model predicts that Munc13–1 may exist in solution as a homodimer that needs to be disrupted in order to bind to α-RIMs at the active zone. The physiological role of Munc13–1 homodimerization is currently unclear, but it is plausible that it may play an inhibitory role by hindering α-RIM binding or it may help to stabilize Munc13–1 in the cytoplasm, before engaging in interactions at the active zone. In any case, the observation that only a small overlap exists between the homodimerization and heterodimerization surfaces of the Munc13–1 C2A domain (Figure 7A) suggests that the homodimer may not need to be fully disrupted for α-RIM binding to be initiated. This feature could facilitate a fast transition between the homodimer and the heterodimer during the sequence of events that leads to vesicle priming.</text><annotation id="50"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0107</infon><location offset="34215" length="338"/><text>Disrupting the interaction between the N-terminal region of Munc13–1 and α-RIMs causes a severe impairment in priming [10,20] that is comparable to that observed in RIM1α knockout mice [16].

In particular, the common requirement of RIM1α and Rab3A for mossy-fiber LTP [15,18] suggests that this form of plasticity depends on the RIM1α/Rab3A interaction. Since Rab3A and RIM1α are localized at synaptic vesicles and active zones, respectively, formation of the tripartite Munc13–1/α-RIM/Rab3A complex could help to approximate Munc13–1 to the membrane fusion machinery assembled between the vesicle and plasma membranes [20]. The structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α ZF domain complex described here shows that Munc13–1 binding to the α-RIM/Rab3A complex should lead to a partial steric clash with Rab3A (Figure 7B), explaining our previous observation that the interaction of the α-RIM SGAWFY motif with Rab3A is released upon Munc13–1 binding [20]. The Munc13–1/α-RIM interaction still allows formation of the tripartite complex because helix a1 of α-RIMs is sufficient for Rab3A binding, but is expected to induce a significant reorientation of the N-terminal structural elements of α-RIMs (Figure 7C). Alternatively, it can be envisaged that Rab3A binding may also cause a rearrangement in α-RIM molecules that were initially bound to Munc13–1. Independently of which event occurs first, the finding that contiguous but partially overlapping surfaces are used by α-RIMs for Munc13–1 and Rab3A binding, and by the Munc13–1 C2A domain for homodimerization and heterodimerization, suggests that a synchronized cascade of protein–protein interactions involving Munc13–1, α-RIMs, and Rab3s may control vesicle priming and facilitate fast refilling of the ready-releasable pool of vesicles during repetitive stimulation.</text><annotation id="52"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0114</infon><location offset="36490" length="319"/><text>The structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α ZF domain complex described here shows that Munc13–1 binding to the α-RIM/Rab3A complex should lead to a partial steric clash with Rab3A (Figure 7B), explaining our previous observation that the interaction of the α-RIM SGAWFY motif with Rab3A is released upon Munc13–1 binding [20].</text></annotation><annotation id="53"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="36490" length="1187"/><text>The structure of the Munc13–1/RIM2α ZF domain complex described here shows that Munc13–1 binding to the α-RIM/Rab3A complex should lead to a partial steric clash with Rab3A (Figure 7B), explaining our previous observation that the interaction of the α-RIM SGAWFY motif with Rab3A is released upon Munc13–1 binding [20].

It is worth noting that phosphorylation of RIM1α by PKA at an N-terminal site between the ZF and PDZ domains is key for mossy-fiber LTP [17], and that the surfaces of Munc13–1 involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization (Figures 2G,6D, and6E) contain several predicted phosphorylation sites (Y23, T25, and Y140). Hence, phosphorylation may be crucial for regulation of inter- and intramolecular interactions of Munc13–1 and α-RIMs during plasticity processes. Evaluation of these possibilities and understanding these mechanisms will require investigation of intramolecular interactions within Munc13–1 and α-RIMs, as well as determination of the interactions involved in the priming activity of the MUN domain, which are currently unclear [7].

In particular, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding is known to be a common activity of many C2 domains that is mediated by loops at one tip of the β-sandwich [21], but it is now clear that many C2 domains do not bind Ca2+ and likely act as protein–protein interaction modules. Our results now reveal for the first time at atomic resolution how a C2 domain engages in protein–protein interactions, showing that the Munc13–1 C2A domain can in fact establish two different types of interactions that lead to either homodimerization with itself or heterodimerization with the RIM2α ZF domain. The Munc13–1 C2A domain does not contain a full complement of Ca2+-binding residues (see [28]) and correspondingly does not bind Ca2+ (unpublished data). Interestingly, heterodimerization with the RIM2α ZF domain occurs through one tip of the C2A-domain β-sandwich, which is opposite to the tip of the β-sandwich commonly involved in Ca2+/phospholipid binding to C2 domains. In contrast, homodimerization involves one side of the β-sandwich. This side contains the concave β-sheet, which interacts with the concave β-sheet of the other monomer in an antiparallel fashion. The interaction involves strand–strand hydrogen bonds through the “naked” edges of the β-sheets, leading to the formation of a β-barrel–like structure. Such form of dimerization is not unusual in β-sheet proteins and may also be a common theme for selected C2 domains. Indeed, homodimerization of the piccolo C2A domain depends on sequences homologous to strand 3 of the Munc13–1 C2A domain [29,30], suggesting that the dimerization mode may be similar. Our demonstration that a C2 domain can participate in two types of protein–protein interactions through distinct surfaces, which in turn differ from the usual Ca2+/phospholipid-binding site of C2 domains, emphasizes the diversity of interactions that can be mediated by a given protein module.

Initial model coordinates were obtained by modifying the coordinates of the rat Munc13–1 C2B domain (unpublished data). Model building (mainly for the missing loops) was carried out by Arp/warp [40] with manual adjustments using O [41]. The Munc13–13–150(K32E)/Rim2α82–142 complex was also determined via molecular replacement using Phaser. Initial model coordinates were taken from the structure of Munc13–13–128. Model building was performed using Arp/warp with minor manual adjustments afterwards. Refinement of the two structures was carried out with Refmac [42] of the CCP4 package [43] with a random subset of all data set aside for the calculation ofRfree. Manual adjustments to the models were carried out with O. After refinement of the protein part was complete, solvent molecules were added using Arp/warp followed by manual adjustments. The models were verified against 2Fo-Fc simulated-annealing omit maps calculated with the program CNS [44]. The simulated-annealing omit maps were found to be virtually identical with regular 2Fo-Fc maps. The structures of Munc13–13–128 and the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/Rim2α82–142 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>50617</offset><text>Analytical ultracentrifugation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50649</offset><text>Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using a 4-position An60Ti rotor and absorbance optical system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California, United States). Each cell has a six-channel carbon-Epon centerpiece with two quartz windows giving an optical path length of 1.2 cm. The sample channels and reference channels were filled with 100-μl proteins and 110-μl buffers, respectively. Absorbance was monitored for each cell in 0.002-cm steps at a wavelength of 280 nm. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, 25,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm, and 35,000 rpm at 4 °C until equilibrium had been reached. After equilibrium was reached, overspeed runs at 42,000 rpm were carried out to obtain baseline values of absorbance, which were used in subsequent fits. The loading concentration of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 were 13.52 μM, 13.65 μM, 12.46 μM, and 12.55 μM in 30 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. The partial specific volumes of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 at 4 °C were calculated from their amino acid composition to be 0.7331 cm3·g−1, 0.7324 cm3·g−1, 0.7327 cm3·g−1, and 0.7170 cm3·g−1, and the calculated monomeric molecular masses are 14,856.9 Da, 16,168.4 Da, 17,821.3 Da, and 24,683.4 Da, respectively. The solvent density was calculated to be 1.005 g·ml−1 at 4 °C. Data sets were fitted to either the single ideal species model or the self-association model using Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Origin 6.03). Global analysis was applied to data sets obtained at the different rotor speeds.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>52471</offset><text>Supporting Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>52494</offset><text>Accession Numbers</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52512</offset><text>The structures of the Munc13–13–128 homodimer and the Munc13–13–150(K32E)/Rim2α82–142 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) with accession numbers 2CJT and 2CJS, respectively.
