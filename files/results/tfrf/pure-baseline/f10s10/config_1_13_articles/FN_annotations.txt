Furthermore, we demonstrated that His-tagged WT-MELK could pull-down with Bcl-GL but His-tagged D150A-MELK could not, indicating that, in vitro, Bcl-GL interacts directly with WT-MELK but not with D150A-MELK (Figure 3d).

GTPase activity was measured as described [38]. Briefly, cultured cortical neurons at DIV7 were pretreated with DMSO or Ros for 30 min, followed by treatment with BDNF for another 5 min. Cells were lysed at 4 °C and incubated with Pak1-PBD agarose with constant rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The proteins bound to the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer at 4 °C, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed for bound Cdc42 by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against Cdc42 (Upstate Biotechnology). GTPase activity was quantified by densitometry analysis of the blots.

GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to further characterize this interaction.

Coimmunoprecipitation of BRCA1 and PP1. HEK293T kidney cells were transfected with vectors encoding untagged BRCA1 under the control of a CMV promoter, and vectors encoding Flag-PP1α, β, γ or Flag-Laf4. (A) A western blot probed with BRCA1 shows that immunoprecipitation of protein with an antibody against the Flag-PP1α, β or γ proteins, but not Laf4, co-immunoprecipitates BRCA1 (Lanes 1A-1D). It should be noted that the band observed slightly lower than BRCA1 in lane 1D is a non-specific background band. Lanes 1E-1H show immunoprecipitation of BRCA1 using antibodies against the amino and carboxy termini of BRCA1. (B) A western blot probed with an antibody against the Flag epitope. Lanes 2A-2D indicate immunoprecipitation of the Flag-epitope tagged PP1α, β or γ or Flag-Laf4. Lanes 2E-2G show co-immunoprecipitation of Flag-PP1α, β or γ with antibodies against BRCA1, and lane 2H shows a lack of coimmunoprecipitation of the negative control Flag-Laf4 by BRCA1.

The samples were crystallized after removing the tag with thrombin, which generated a four-residue (Gly–Ser–His–Met) peptide N-terminal to the native Asp5 residue.

Interestingly, APPL1 would bind to Rab21 in a GTP-dependent manner (Figure 4), indicating that APPL1 is an effector for both Rab5 and Rab21.

(B) Subcellular localization of endogenous and exogenous UXT. 293T cells were transfected with (top) or without (bottom) FLAG-UXT. Immunofluorescentmicroscopy was performed with the indicated primary antibodies.

Alternatively, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to support this speculation. Interestingly, when transfecting cells with siRNA against UXT and stimulating them with TNF-α, there were an apparently decreased percentage of cells that displayed focused nuclear p65. Approximately 90% of control cells displayed p65 inside the nucleus upon stimulation, whereas only 35–50% displayed p65 in the case of the UXT knockdown specimen (Fig. 5 E).

Next, we used the recombinant, purified MRN complex in peptide pull-down experiments. These showed that MRN bound to the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated form of the SDTD peptide—confirming the direct nature of the interaction—yet did not bind to either version of the H2AX C-terminal peptide (Fig 3A). This indicates the specificity of MRN for the phosphorylated MDC1 SDTD motif and also shows that if, as previously reported, NBS1 binds to γH2AX directly (Kobayashi et al, 2002), this interaction must be less stable than MRN binding to the phosphorylated SDTD motif.

The wild-type MDC1 derivative efficiently co-immunoprecipitated MRN at physiological salt concentrations, whereas only low levels of MRN were recovered in immunoprecipitates of the MDC1SDTDΔ mutant (Fig 4B), consistent with the SDTD region being the principal MRN interaction interface.

(B) Indicated expression constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. After 48 h, extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitated (IP) with GFP antibodies and immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitations and washes were performed at 150 mM salt; INP, input (5%). (C,D) Indicated osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell lines were treated with two rounds of control (CNTL) or MDC1-targeting siRNA for 72 h. Cells were then treated with 5 Gy of X-rays and processed for immunofluorescence 4 h later with MDC1, (C) NBS1 or (D) 53BP1 antibodies (non-irradiated cells are shown in supplementary Fig S4B,C online).
