More importantly, when siRNA of UXT, which blocked NF-κB activity, was used in combination with TNF and CHX, we detected drastically morphological changes under light microscopy and ∼50% of cells undergoing apoptosis.
Alternatively, we used annexin V and TUNEL methods to quantitatively measure the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis.
Consistently, a considerable increase of apoptotic cells was observed in samples with reduced UXT (Fig.
8, B and C).
These indicated that the knockdown of UXT sensitizes 293T cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-α.
