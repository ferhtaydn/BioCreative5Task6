To determine the functional interactions of RCK/p54 with miRISC, we employed affinity purification of RISC and target mRNA cleavage capabilities of miRISC when the target has perfectly complementary sequences to the miRNAs.
To dissect and understand the relationship between RNAi function and P-bodies, we affinity-purified RISC using Myc-Ago2 and expression vectors of the YFP-tagged P-body proteins, Lsm1, RCK/p54, Dcp2, and eIF4E.
Ago2 interacted with these various P-body components in ways that were RNA-dependent or RNA-independent (Figure 1A).
(A) Affinity-purified miRISCs associated with PCK/p54 retain cleavage activity.
To purify miRISC associated with RCK/p54, magnetic protein A beads coupled with rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-Ago2, or rabbit anti-RCK/p54 antibodies were incubated with HeLa cytoplasmic extracts.
After immunoprecipitation, RISC activities were analyzed by incubating the supernatant (S) or bead (B) phases with 182-nt 32P-cap-labeled let-7 substrate mRNAs having a perfectly complementary or mismatched sequence to the let-7 miRNA.
Cleavage products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.
CE, cytoplasmic extract; PM, perfect match; MM, mismatch.The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Bcl-GL recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon-plus RIL competent cells (Stratagene).
Purification of the recombinant proteins was performed using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) under nondenaturing conditions according to the supplier's instructions.
For confirmation of direct binding of BCL-GL and MELK, we removed GST from GST-fused BCL-GL protein using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) according to the supplier's instructions.Recombinant proteins of human APPL1 N-terminal fragments including the BAR (residues 5−265) and BAR-PH domains (residues 5−385) were expressed in Escherichia coli, then purified using His tag affinity chromatography.
His-tagged proteins of APPL1 (5−265) and APPL1 (5−385) were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins in BL21 StarTM (DE3) strain of E.
coli (Invitrogen), and cells were harvested after induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 25°C.
The cells were lysed with lysozyme, and the lysate supernatant was purified with His-SelectTM affinity beads (Sigma).
In both cases, the His tag was removed with thrombin.
Recombinant proteins of human Rab5a variants (GenBank ID: NM_004162), human Rab21 (BC021901), and human Rab22a (NM_020673) fused with an N-terminal GST were expressed in BL21 E.
coli and purified with GST-affinity chromatography.
The sample was concentrated to ∼20 mg ml−1 and stored in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% (v/v) βME at −80°C.
Recombinant protein of human rabaptin5 (551–862) (GenBank ID: CAA62580) was expressed and purified as described previously (Zhai et al, 2003); two additional point mutations, C719S and C734S, were introduced to reduce aggregation.Soluble fractions were filtered with 0.8 μm syringe filters and applied into a Ni-NTA affinity column pre-equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol.
Target protein complexes (the Aα subunit with GST-tag and SV40 ST with His-tag) were eluted with elution buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT.
Dialyzed protein was applied to a GST affinity column to remove free SV40 ST, and on-column cleavage with TEV protease was performed at 4 °C overnight.
The flow-through fraction of the GST column was reapplied into the Ni-NTA column to remove cleaved His-tag and TEV protease.The transformed bacteria were cultured in L-Broth with addition of 100 uM of IPTG to induce GST-fusion protein expression.
Then, the bacteria were harvested and subjected to GST fusion protein purification by Sonication and using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience).Recombinant full-length human Bcl-XL (or Bcl-XL Y101K) with no additional amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal intein/chitin-binding domain fusion and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column followed by further purification on a phenyl-Sepharose column, similar to a method described previously [7] but with a final dialysis step to remove detergents.
For ΔTM Bcl-XL (and the ΔTM Y101K mutant), the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography step was omitted.
Recombinant full-length human Bax and murine tBid (or tBid-mt1) with no additional amino acids were purified as described previously [7,9].α-parvin-CHC was purified as follows: cleared cell lysate (in 75 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) in binding buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) washed with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM benzamidine, and was eluted with 50 mM glutathione in binding buffer (pH 8.0).
To purify full-length α-parvin, cleared cell lysate in 200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 5 mM benzamidine, 2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), washed with 200 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM NaCl, and 4 mM DTT, and α−parvin was released by cleavage with recombinant human rhinovirus 3C-protease at 4°C over night.
