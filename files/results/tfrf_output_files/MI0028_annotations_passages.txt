Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using a 4-position An60Ti rotor and absorbance optical system (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California, United States). Each cell has a six-channel carbon-Epon centerpiece with two quartz windows giving an optical path length of 1.2 cm. The sample channels and reference channels were filled with 100-μl proteins and 110-μl buffers, respectively. Absorbance was monitored for each cell in 0.002-cm steps at a wavelength of 280 nm. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, 25,000 rpm, 30,000 rpm, and 35,000 rpm at 4 °C until equilibrium had been reached. After equilibrium was reached, overspeed runs at 42,000 rpm were carried out to obtain baseline values of absorbance, which were used in subsequent fits. The loading concentration of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 were 13.52 μM, 13.65 μM, 12.46 μM, and 12.55 μM in 30 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. The partial specific volumes of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 at 4 °C were calculated from their amino acid composition to be 0.7331 cm3·g−1, 0.7324 cm3·g−1, 0.7327 cm3·g−1, and 0.7170 cm3·g−1, and the calculated monomeric molecular masses are 14,856.9 Da, 16,168.4 Da, 17,821.3 Da, and 24,683.4 Da, respectively. The solvent density was calculated to be 1.005 g·ml−1 at 4 °C. Data sets were fitted to either the single ideal species model or the self-association model using Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Origin 6.03). Global analysis was applied to data sets obtained at the different rotor speeds.
