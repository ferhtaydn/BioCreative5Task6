To determine whether isolated CgE (gE residues 213–390, where residue 1 is the first residue of the hydrophobic leader peptide in the immature gE and residue 420 is the first residue of the predicted transmembrane region) binds Fc and to measure the affinity of the interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance assay using two forms of recombinant Fc derived from human IgG1: wild-type Fc (wtFc) and nbFc, which contains six point mutations in the CH2-CH3 linker that abrogate binding to gE-gI (Met252 to Gly, Ile253 to Gly, His310 to Glu, His433 to Glu, His435 to Glu, and Tyr436 to Ala) [12]. The Fc proteins were immobilized on the surface of a biosensor chip, and the binding of CgE was assayed at pH 8 and pH 6.
Surface plasmon resonance studies were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). In this system, binding between a molecule coupled to a biosensor chip (the “ligand”) and a second molecule injected over the chip (the “analyte”) results in changes in the surface plasmon resonance signal that are read out in real time as resonance units [54]. wtFc and nbFc, both derived from human IgG1, were purified from CHO cell supernatants as described previously [12] and immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip (Biacore) using primary-amine coupling as described by the manufacturer. Equilibrium binding data for CgE binding to wtFc (coupling density, 440 resonance units), nbFc (coupling density, 405 resonance units), and a mock-coupled flow cell were collected for a CgE concentration series (three-fold dilutions of CgE from 30 μM to 5 nM) at pH 8 (50 mM HEPES [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% [vol/vol] P-20 surfactant) and pH 6 (50 mM sodium phosphate [pH 6.0], 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% [vol/vol] P-20 surfactant). After each injection of CgE, a 30-s injection of 250 mM di-ammonium hydrogen citrate (pH 5.0) was used to disrupt the interaction and restore the surface.Binding affinity between full-length Rab5-Q79L and APPL1 (5−419) was quantitatively determined in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment. Rab5 was coupled to the SPR biosensor chip in random orientations, and APPL1 (5−419) was applied as the analyte at concentrations of 0.15−12 μM (Supplementary Figure 4). The dissociation constant, kd, for the Rab5−APPL1 interaction measured from this experiment was 0.9 (±0.7) μM, with kon and koff of 1.3 (±0.6) × 103 M−1 s−1, and 1.2 (±0.4) × 10−3 s−1, respectively. This kd value is typical for an interaction between a Rab and its effectors (Eathiraj et al, 2005).
