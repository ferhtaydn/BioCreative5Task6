X-ray diffraction studies guided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments reveal the crystal structures of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer and the Munc13–1 C2A-domain/RIM ZF heterodimer at 1.44 Å and 1.78 Å resolution, respectively. The C2A domain adopts a β-sandwich structure with a four-stranded concave side that mediates homodimerization, leading to the formation of an eight-stranded β-barrel. In contrast, heterodimerization involves the bottom tip of the C2A-domain β-sandwich and a C-terminal α-helical extension, which wrap around the RIM ZF domain. Our results describe the structural basis for a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/RIM heterodimer switch that may be crucial for vesicle priming and presynaptic plasticity, uncovering at the same time an unexpected versatility of C2 domains as protein–protein interaction modules, and illustrating the power of combining NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to study protein complexes.
Guided by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the Munc13–1 C2A-domain homodimer at 1.44 Å resolution, designed a mutation that disrupts homodimerization, and solved the X-ray crystal structure at 1.78 Å resolution of a Munc13–1 fragment bearing this mutation bound to the RIM2α ZF domain.
Moreover, our data uncover an unexpected versatility of C2 domains as protein–protein interaction modules that underlies this switch, and emphasize that combining NMR spectroscopy with X-ray crystallography provides a powerful approach to investigate protein complexes at atomic resolution.
NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography provide complementary tools to study protein structure. X-ray crystallography is better suited to elucidate the structures of large proteins and accurately define interfaces of protein complexes, but requires crystallization, which can yield artifacts due to crystal packing. Furthermore, unfolded regions and non-specific aggregation can hinder crystallization, and these properties need to be monitored by alternative techniques. NMR spectroscopy can be performed in solution, and low-resolution information on the conformational and aggregation states of proteins can be quickly obtained even for large species using heteronuclear NMR experiments such as1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC). These spectra contain one cross-peak for each non-proline residue of a15N-labeled protein and exhibit well-dispersed cross-peak patterns for well-folded proteins, whereas unfolding or misfolding leads to poor cross-peak dispersion. Moreover, binding interactions and conformational changes can be monitored by perturbations of the cross-peaks, and unusual cross-peak broadening reports on sample aggregation. In this study, we took advantage of the strengths of both techniques, using NMR spectroscopy to optimize protein complexes for crystallization and to obtain structural information in solution that was later employed to interpret the high-resolution structures of these complexes elucidated by X-ray crystallography.
Moreover, the gel filtration and ITC data (Figure 4A and4B), as well as the high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex and the observation of only one set of cross-peaks (Figure 4C), demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry. All these results strongly suggest that the monomer A/RIM2α82–142 complex observed in the crystals faithfully reflects the true Munc13–1/RIM2α binding mode, whereas the presence of a second Munc13–13–150(K32E) molecule in the crystals must be considered a consequence of crystal packing.
Note also that the mutated Munc13–1 side chain (E32) is close to the interface with the ZF domain, but is facing away, consistent with the conclusion drawn from the NMR analysis that the mutation does not substantially alter the binding mode.
Thus, NMR studies showed that a long α-helix (helix a1) and an SGAWFY motif at the end of the short α-helix at the C-terminus of the RIM2α ZF domain (helix a2) bind to Rab3A, and that the interaction involving the SGAWFY motif is released upon binding of Munc13–1 to the ZF domain. Figure 7B shows that the α-helical extension at the C-terminus of the Munc13–1 C2A domain would have steric clashes with Rab3A upon binding to RIM2α. All these observations lead to the model of Figure 7C, which proposes that formation of the Munc13–1/RIM/Rab3A tripartite complex requires disruption of the Munc13–1 homodimer and a change in the relative orientation of the structural elements of RIM.
Our results illustrate the power of combining X-ray crystallography with NMR spectroscopy to study structural aspects of protein complexes, and suggest that a complex cascade of protein–protein interactions, including a Munc13–1 homodimer–Munc13–1/α-RIM heterodimer switch, may regulate synaptic vesicle priming and some forms of presynaptic plasticity.
1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Varian INOVA500, INOVA600, or INOVA800 spectrometers (Varian, Palo Alto, California, United States) using H2O/D2O 95:5 (v/v) as the solvent. Samples contained 0.1 mM15N-labeled Munc13–1 fragments, alone or together with 0.15 mM unlabeled Rim2α82–142, dissolved in 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP.
(E) Superposition of the structure of the RIM2α ZF domain observed in the heterodimer (blue) and its solution structure determined in isolation by NMR spectroscopy (red) [20].To confirm the specificity of AIRE–PHD1 for H3K4me0, we compared the binding of histone H3 N-terminal peptides—H3K4me0, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3—to AIRE–PHD1 by using two dimensional 1H-15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A discrete set of chemical shift changes was observed on addition of all four histone H3 peptides to AIRE–PHD1 (supplementary Fig S2A,B online). However, the intensity of the changes was inversely related to the methylation level of the H3 peptide: the H3K4me0 peptide induced the largest changes (maximum average chemical shift change Δδmaxav=0.9 p.p.m.; Fig 2). The addition of H3K4me0 and H3K4me1 peptides resulted in chemical shift changes in the slow- to intermediate-exchange regime (supplementary Fig S2A online), indicating low micromolar binding affinities. By contrast, the NMR data on addition of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 peptides were in the fast-exchange regime, indicating millimolar binding affinities (supplementary Fig S2B online).
The mapping of the H3/AIRE interaction site uniquely to AIRE–PHD1 was further confirmed by NMR titrations of histone H3 peptides into AIRE–PHD2, which bound neither methylated nor H3K4me0 peptides (data not shown).
Accordingly, the amides of C310, L308 and G306 showed high protection factors in NMR deuterium exchange experiments, confirming their involvement in H-bonds (Fig 3B).
The formation of salt bridges between the side chains of R2 and D312, and between K4 and D297 seemed to be crucial for binding specificity, as indicated experimentally by the large NMR chemical shift changes for G313 (near to D312) and D297 (Fig 2).
The model of AIRE–PHD1 complexed with H3K4me0 was in perfect agreement with the experimental chemical shift perturbation data, as the peptide-binding region coincided with the binding surface identified by NMR spectroscopy (Fig 3A). In fact, the H3K4me0 peptide induced chemical shift changes in AIRE–PHD1 residues that map only on one side of the protein surface, involving residues in the N terminus of the PHD finger, the first β-strand, and the loop connecting the first and the second β-strands (D297, G305, G306, L308, C310, D312 and G313; Fig 2; supplementary Fig S5 online). A similar pattern of chemical shift changes indicated the same binding site for H3K4me1.Furthermore, two tertiary structures of a zinc-finger domain of hTFIIEα (Okuda et al, 2004) and a winged helix/forkhead domain of hTFIIEβ (Okuda et al, 2000) have been solved by NMR spectroscopy.
We have determined structures of both free hTFIIEα AC-D and its form bound to the PH-D of hTFIIH p62 by using NMR spectroscopy. The structures reveal that hTFIIEα AC-D recognizes p62 PH-D tightly through a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.
To characterize the precise interaction at the molecular level, we first solved a solution structure of the AC-D of hTFIIEα using NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1B and Table I).
Recently, the structure of a complex of the PH-D of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tfb1, a homologue of human p62, with a TAD2 of activator p53 was determined by NMR spectroscopy (Di Lello et al, 2006).While this manuscript was in preparation, an independent study reported the NMR structure of the C-terminal CH domain of α-parvin in complex with a 10-residue peptide derived from the paxillin LD1 motif (Wang et al., 2008).
This analysis together with NMR studies of a spin-labeled LD1 peptide supports the surprising finding that LD motifs can associate with a single binding site bidirectionally.
However, we previously demonstrated that LD-binding to the FAT domain of FAK does not reside in a local peptide sequence such as the PBS (Hoellerer et al., 2003) and thus investigated the interaction of α-parvin-CHC with LD motifs using solution NMR. 1H-15N HSQC monitored titrations of 15N-enriched α-parvin-CHC were performed with peptides representing all five paxillin LD motifs. Each peptide was found to induce resonance-specific chemical shift perturbations (Figure 2 and data not shown), indicating an interaction with α-parvin-CHC.
As measured by NMR, none of these substitutions substantially altered the binding affinity for α-parvin-CHC, indicating that the predicted electrostatic contacts are energetically neutral under the assay conditions (50 mM sodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl [pH 6.9]) used.
The resulting KD-value for α-parvin-CHC is similar to the corresponding value obtained by NMR, supporting the validity of our results (Table 2). Importantly, the KD-values for α-parvin-CHC and full-length α-parvin are the same within error (Table 2), suggesting that the N-terminal region of α-parvin (residues 1–242) makes little net contribution to LD binding. We thus conclude that the crystal structures of the α-parvin-CHC/LD complexes along with the solution NMR studies presented here provide a relevant description of LD recognition by α-parvin.
This binding site is consistent with the one described in a recent solution NMR structure of α-parvin-CHC in complex with an LD1 peptide (Wang et al., 2008).
Recent NMR studies (Zhang et al., 2008) have also demonstrated that the single LD binding site of PKL/GIT1 binds to both LD4 (Turner et al., 1999) and LD2. Taken together, these observations suggest that paxillin LD motifs are promiscuous protein interaction modules.
Data were recorded on home-built or Bruker spectrometers with 11.7, 14.1, 17.6, and 22.3 T field strengths and processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995). Backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained using standard triple resonance experiments. Peptide titration experiments were performed by mixing two stock solutions (in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% D2O, and 30 μM DSS [pH 6.9]) containing 235 μM 15N-enriched α-parvin-CHC and either no or a maximum concentration of LD peptide at the required protein/ligand ratios (Figure S2). Phase-sensitive gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Kay et al., 1992) were recorded at 25°C.
