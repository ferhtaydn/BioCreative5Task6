Bound protein was eluted in buffer containing 40 mM Tris (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole, and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) that was equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) and 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5).
Various forms of gE and the gE-gI heterodimer were subcloned, expressed, and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cell supernatants by nickel affinity and/or IgG affinity and gel-filtration chromatography as described previously [12]. Two recombinant forms of the Fc fragment of IgG1, wtFc and heterodimeric Fc, which contain two and one gE-gI binding sites, respectively, were also produced in CHO cells and purified as described previously [12].The predicted C2A domain of Munc13–1 encompasses approximately residues 3–130. Using Munc13–1 fragments containing residues 3–132 (Munc13–13–132), 3–150 (Munc13–13–150), 3–209 (Munc13–13–209), and 105–228, we previously showed that the C2A domain is essential for binding to the RIM2α ZF domain (RIM2α82–142), but additional sequences at its C-terminus are necessary for tight binding [20]. In agreement with these conclusions, Munc13–13–150 and Munc13–13–209 (but not Munc13–13–132) largely co-elute with RIM2α82–142 in gel filtration experiments with an apparent molecular weight characteristic of a 1:1 heterodimer (Figure 1B and [20]). Interestingly, the apparent molecular weights observed for isolated Munc13–13–132, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209 in gel filtration were significantly higher than their monomeric molecular weights (Figure 1B and unpublished data), suggesting that they form stable dimers.
Gel filtration showed that both point mutations disrupt dimerization of Munc13–13–128, Munc13–13–150, and Munc13–13–209, but preserve heterodimerization with RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4A and unpublished data).
The fusion proteins were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), cleaved from the GST moiety, and further purified by size-exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography. Gel-filtration binding experiments were performed on Superdex S75 or S200 columns (Amersham) in 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) at pH 7.4.The flow-through fraction of the Ni-NTA column was concentrated and applied into a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT.In incubations of 20 nM tBid and liposomes, tBid bound effectively to liposomes as assayed by gel filtration chromatography (Figure 1B).
(A) Quantification of Bax binding to membranes. Bax (100 nM) and tBid (20 nM) or tBid-mt1 were incubated with liposomes in the presence of increasing concentrations of Bcl-XL, Bcl-XL Y101K, or Bcl-XL ΔBH4. Membrane-bound protein was separated from soluble protein by Sepharose CL-2B gel filtration chromatography and quantified by immunoblotting.
Although our results indicate that Bcl-XL inhibits tBid-mediated activation of Bax by sequestering tBid in a stable complex, it is unclear how Bcl-XL inhibits Bax binding to membranes. For example, Bcl-XL might inhibit Bax binding to membranes by preventing it from interacting with tBid. Alternatively or in addition, Bcl-XL might directly inhibit Bax binding to membranes. To determine the mechanism(s) involved, we measured Bax liposome binding by gel filtration chromatography for reactions containing the different mutant proteins (Figure 4A).
The incubation of Bax with liposomes alone does not cause sufficiently tight membrane binding by Bax to survive gel filtration chromatography (Figure 1B).
All sample components (buffers, liposomes, etc.) were added prior to the addition of recombinant proteins, which were added in the order Bcl-XL, Bax, and tBid. Membrane-bound protein was separated from soluble (“free”) protein using gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B resin. Membrane binding was measured by comparing the intensities of membrane-bound proteins (fractions 3 and 4) with total proteins (fractions 3 and 4 plus fractions 8–11). Separation of membrane-bound protein from soluble (“free”) protein by liposome floatation on a sucrose density gradient was performed as previously described [57].After cleavage with recombinant human rhinovirus 3C-protease, the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare) in 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 2 mM EDTA.
