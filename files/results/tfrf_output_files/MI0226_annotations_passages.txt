Recombinant purified His-tagged Bcl-xL was exposed to alkaline conditions to cause partial deamidation and separated by anion-exchange chromatography into three peaks (Figure 2C, peaks A, B and C).
(C) Anion exchange chromatography of purified rBcl-xL. Sample A was untreated; samples B and C were exposed to pH 8.8 at 37 °C for 2 h and 20 h, respectively. The Figure illustrates superimposed elution profiles for each sample. Peaks A, B, and C had molecular masses of 25, 015.6; 25, 016.4, and 25, 017.2, respectively.
(D) Bim binds to native but not to deamidated rBcl-xL. The three different forms of Bcl-xL (A, B, and C) purified by anion-exchange column chromatography shown in (C) were incubated in wild-type thymic lysates (1.5 × 107 cell equivalents) at 4 °C for 2 h and then precipitated using nickel beads. The precipitated products were immunoblotted for Bim and Bcl-xL.After further purification with Resource-QTM anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare), both protein samples were concentrated to ∼30 mg ml−1 in (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (βME)) and stored at −85°C until needed. APPL1 (5−419) mutants were expressed similarly. Se-Met-substituted proteins were expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) in minimal media supplemented with 40 mg l−1 Se-Met (Sigma) and purified using the same procedure as the native protein.After elution with 200 mM potassium phosphate, 10 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT, and 2.5% glycerol, the protein was dialyzed into 25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol for subsequent anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, GE Healthcare) and gradient elution with 250 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 15 mM NaCl, 250 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, and 2.5% glycerol.
