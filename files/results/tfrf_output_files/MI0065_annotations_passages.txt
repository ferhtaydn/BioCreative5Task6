Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the ability of Munc13–13–150(K32E) to bind to RIM2α82–142 (Figure 4B), yielding an apparent Kd of 0.10 μM and a 1:1 stoichiometry.
Moreover, the gel filtration and ITC data (Figure 4A and4B), as well as the high quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Munc13–13–150(K32E)/RIM2α82–142 complex and the observation of only one set of cross-peaks (Figure 4C), demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry. All these results strongly suggest that the monomer A/RIM2α82–142 complex observed in the crystals faithfully reflects the true Munc13–1/RIM2α binding mode, whereas the presence of a second Munc13–13–150(K32E) molecule in the crystals must be considered a consequence of crystal packing.
ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal, Northampton, Massachusetts, United States) at 20 °C in a buffer composed of 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. The proteins were extensively dialyzed against the buffer, centrifuged, and degassed before the experiment. Typically, 200 μM Rim2α82–142 was injected in 35 aliquots of 8 μl into a 1.8-ml sample cell containing 10–20 μM Munc13–13–150(K32E). Data were fit with a non-linear least-squares routine using a single-site binding model with Origin for ITC v.5.0 (Microcal), varying the stoichiometry(n), the enthalpy of the reaction (ΔH) and the association constant (Ka).The greater binding affinity of AIRE–PHD1 for H3K4me0 peptides was confirmed by both tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), yielding dissociation constants of ∼4 μM, ∼20 μM and >0.5 mM for H3K4me0, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively (supplementary Fig S2C online; Table 1).
Indeed, fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC assays showed that the alanine mutations R2A in the H3 peptide and D312A in AIRE–PHD1 markedly reduced the binding affinity (Table 1; Fig 4C) without affecting the protein fold (supplementary Fig S3 online).
Similarly, pull-down experiments with whole histones and the H3K4me0 peptide, together with fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC measurements performed on AIRE–PHD1-D297A showed reduced binding (Table 1; Fig 4).

In hTFIIEα AC-D, the NMR signals of E386, F387, E388, E389, V390, A391 and D392 were changed significantly upon addition of p62 PH-D (Supplementary Figure 1B) and also in p62 PH-D the NMR signals of K19, Q53, K54, I55, S56, E58, K60, A61, I63, Q64, L65, Q66, T74, T75 and F77 were changed by adding hTFIIEα AC-D (Supplementary Figure 2B).
To investigate whether the STDE is involved in the binding, we prepared a longer construct (residues 351–439) containing both acidic regions and performed the NMR titration experiment under the same conditions (Supplementary Figure 4). The result was that the NMR signals of STDE showed no significant changes and the Kd of 400±43 nM was almost the same as that estimated using hTFIIEα AC-D.
The binding site of hTFIIH p62 PH-D was localized to the second β-sheet (S5, S6 and S7), the loops between S1 and S2 and between S5 and S6 and the C-terminal H1 helix, where a substantial positive cluster is formed. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the N-terminal highly acidic tail of hTFIIEα AC-D strongly binds to the positively charged surface of hTFIIH p62 PH-D. This is supported by the result that the binding is strengthened by removing NaCl from the buffer in the NMR titration experiments.
The Kd values for the binding of p53 TAD2 to p62 and Tfb1 PH-Ds determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) are 3175±570 and 391±74 nM, respectively (Di Lello et al, 2006). In the binding of VP16 TAD to Tfb1 PH-D, the Kd value estimated by NMR titration experiment was ∼4000–7000 nM (Di Lello et al, 2005). Compared with these Kd values, the binding of hTFIIEα AC-D to p62 PH-D is rather strong.
The binding affinity of p53 TAD2 to p62 PH-D is regulated by S46 and T55 phosphorylation (Di Lello et al, 2006). The Kd values of p53 TAD2 to p62 PH-D are reported for the unphosphorylated form as 3175±570 nM, for the S46-phosphorylated form as 518±92 nM, for the T55-phosphorylated form as 457±75 nM and for both S46- and T55-phosphorylated form as 97±33 nM. Very recent ITC studies demonstrated the Kd value of hTFIIEα336−439 to p62 PH-D to be 45±25 nM (Di Lello et al, 2008).Using NMR titrations, we have shown that this binding site interacts with all five paxillin LD motifs, exhibiting a preference for LD1, LD2, and LD4 over the less conserved LD3 and LD5. This could be due to differences in specific contacts and/or helical propensity of the latter two LD motifs.
