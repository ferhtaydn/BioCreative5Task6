It has previously been shown in a variety of model systems that B-type cyclin/CDK complexes, kinesin-5 motors, and the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase are required for the separation of spindle poles and assembly of a bipolar spindle. It has been suggested that, in budding yeast, B-type cyclin/CDK (Clb/Cdc28) complexes promote spindle pole separation by inhibiting the degradation of the kinesins-5 Kip1 and Cin8 by the anaphase-promoting complex (APCCdh1). We have determined, however, that the Kip1 and Cin8 proteins are present at wild-type levels in the absence of Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity. Here, we show that Kip1 and Cin8 are in vitro targets of Clb2/Cdc28 and that the mutation of conserved CDK phosphorylation sites on Kip1 inhibits spindle pole separation without affecting the protein's in vivo localization or abundance. Mass spectrometry analysis confirms that two CDK sites in the tail domain of Kip1 are phosphorylated in vivo. In addition, we have determined that Sic1, a Clb/Cdc28-specific inhibitor, is the SCFCdc4 target that inhibits spindle pole separation in cells lacking functional Cdc4. Based on these findings, we propose that Clb/Cdc28 drives spindle pole separation by direct phosphorylation of kinesin-5 motors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1539</offset><text>Author Summary</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1554</offset><text>The assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle is essential for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and, hence, for successful cell division. Spindle assembly depends on the successful duplication of the spindle poles, followed by their separation to opposing ends of the cell. Although it has been known for many years that B-cyclin/CDK complexes regulate the assembly of the mitotic spindle, the relevant CDK targets have not been identified. Motor proteins of the kinesin-5 family generate movement on the microtubules that make up the spindle and are believed to power spindle pole separation. By employing the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we have found evidence that cyclin/CDKs control spindle assembly by phosphorylating the kinesins-5 Kip1 and Cin8. When phosphorylation at a conserved CDK site in the motor domain of Kip1 is blocked, spindle pole separation is greatly diminished but neither protein abundance nor localization is affected. We have also obtained direct evidence by mass spectrometry that Kip1 and Cin8 are phosphorylated in vivo at consensus CDK sites in their tail domains. Our findings suggest that B-cyclin/CDKs regulate spindle assembly by regulating kinesin-5 motor activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2802</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2815</offset><text>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) complexed with various cyclins coordinate many duplication and segregation events during the eukaryotic cell division cycle [1], [2]. The duplication of the cell's microtubule organizing center, the centrosome, and the subsequent separation of the duplicated centrosomes is one such event [3], [4]. Timely separation of the duplicated centrosomes is required for the assembly of the bipolar spindle at metaphase which, in turn, is necessary for the equal segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase and the preservation of genome stability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3393</offset><text>The budding yeast centrosome, called the spindle pole body (SPB), is functionally equivalent to the metazoan centrosome. Although structurally dissimilar [5], they appear to be regulated by similar mechanisms [3], [6]. Thus, the budding yeast SPB is a powerful model for understanding the metazoan centrosome, as demonstrated by genetic studies that have identified many components of the eukaryotic cellular machinery critical to both SPB and centrosome separation (reviewed in [5]-[9]).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3884</offset><text>Three classes of mutations that cause cells to arrest with duplicated but unseparated SPBs have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first class includes mutations in the genes encoding Cdc28, the yeast Cdk1, and the B-cyclins which bind to Cdc28. Cells lacking all six B-type cyclin genes (CLB1, CLB2, CLB3, CLB4, CLB5, and CLB6) are unable to separate SPBs [4]. The mutation of tyrosine 19 in Cdc28 to mimic an inhibitory phosphorylation (cdc28Y19E) [10], [11] has also been reported to result in a SPB separation defect [12]. This phosphomimetic mutation is thought to specifically inhibit Clb1,2,3,4/Cdc28 complexes, but likely not Clb5,6/Cdc28 [11]. Not surprisingly, Deltaclb1,2,3,4 mutants also appear to have a diminished capacity to separate SPBs [13], , although separation can occur after extended time periods [4], [13].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4726</offset><text>The second class of SPB separation mutations affects genes encoding components of the SCFCdc4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CDC4, CDC53 and SKP1 [15]-[17]) as well as CDC34 [18], the E2 ubiquitin protein-conjugating enzyme that is associated with SCFCdc4. Temperature-sensitive cdc4, cdc53, and cdc34 mutants arrest with multiple elongated buds and unreplicated DNA, as well as duplicated but unseparated SPBs [15]-[19]. The arrest phenotype of these mutants is likely to be identical to that of Deltaclb1,2,3,4,5,6 [4], [20] mutants due to a buildup of Sic1 [15], [20]. Sic1 is a Clb/Cdc28-specific inhibitor whose degradation is normally triggered by the SCFCdc4 complex in G1 to allow entry into S phase [20]-[22]. However, it is possible that there is a SCFCdc4 target that is directly involved in maintaining cohesion between the duplicated SPBs and which must be destroyed before separation can occur. Such a protein could be a component of the proteinaceous bridge structure that physically joins newly duplicated SPBs and would need to be overcome for separation to occur [8], [9]. Direct phosphorylation by CDK complexes is generally required to trigger the ubiquitination of SCF targets [23]; so Clb/Cdc28 complexes might work in concert with the SCFCdc4 to destroy such a separation-inhibiting element.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6042</offset><text>The third class of mutations lies in the KIP1 and CIN8 genes [24], [25] which encode members of the kinesin-5 family of bipolar, microtubule-based motor proteins [26]. Kinesins-5 have been shown to be important in both the establishment and maintenance of the bipolar spindle in many fungal and metazoan systems [27]-[30]. It is thought that kinesin-5 motors crosslink and move spindle microtubules, which are also required for SPB separation [31], [32], in order to mechanically separate the spindle poles and establish the spindle (reviewed in [33]). Accordingly, cells lacking both functional Kip1 and Cin8, arrest with duplicated and unseparated SPBs when released from a G1 arrest [24], [25].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6742</offset><text>Together, these findings suggest that Clb/Cdc28 complexes promote the timely separation of SPBs, and that kinesin-5 motors may be subject to phosphoregulation by Clb/Cdc28 complexes [14], [34]. Although several of the genetic requirements for SPB separation are now known, the molecular mechanisms that regulate separation remain unclear. cyclin B/Cdk1 phosphorylation of the tail domain of the Homo sapiens [35], [36], Xenopus laevis [37], [38], and Drosophila melanogaster [39], [40] kinesin-5 orthologues (HsEg5 or Kif11, XlEg5, and KLP61F, respectively) has been shown to be required for their localization to the spindle. The BimC box motif [28] where this phosphorylation occurs is not found, however, in either Kip1 or Cin8, although other consensus CDK phosphorylation sites exist in both proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7549</offset><text>Two recent studies [41], [42] suggest that Clb/Cdc28 complexes regulate kinesin-5 protein stability indirectly by phosphorylating Cdh1, a substrate-specific activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) [43]. The APCCdh1 is active in G1, and is thought to be inactivated in S phase by B-cyclin/CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Cdh1 [44], [45]. The degradation of Kip1 and Cin8 is dependent on the APC in complex with Cdc20 [46] or with Cdh1 [47], respectively. Motor stability thus depends on APC activity. The studies by Crasta et al., however, relied heavily on two mutant alleles of CDC28, cdc28Y19E and cdc28-as1, which retain some CDK activity under the experimental conditions employed [41], [48]. They therefore do not rule out the possibility that CDKs also regulate kinesin-5 motors directly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8354</offset><text>In this study, we asked if Clb/Cdc28 directly regulates kinesin-5 activity in order to trigger SPB separation and spindle assembly. We first determined that the only target of SCFCdc4 involved in regulating SPB separation is the Clb/Cdc28-specific inhibitor, Sic1. Thus, SCF-mediated destruction of a bridge component is likely not required for spindle assembly. We next determined that Clb2/Cdc28 phosphorylates Kip1 and Cin8 in vitro, and also that Clb/Cdc28 complexes do not regulate either the abundance or localization of these kinesins-5 in vivo. Moreover, by genetic mapping, we identified a CDK phosphorylation site in the motor domain of Kip1 that is critical to SPB separation. We also identified two non-conserved CDK sites in the tail domain of Kip1 that are important for timely SPB separation, and verified that they are phosphorylated in vivo by mass spectrometry. As the site in the motor domain is conserved across almost all of the kinesin-5 family, we propose that direct regulation of kinesin-5 motor functions by B-cyclin/CDK may not be exclusive to S. cerevisiae.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9440</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9448</offset><text>Deleting SIC1 is sufficient to permit SPB separation in cells lacking functional Cdc4</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9534</offset><text>Mutants lacking SCFCdc4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity fail to separate duplicated SPBs. This observation suggests that there is a protein or proteins that must be ubiquitinated by the SCFCdc4 and subsequently degraded in order for the SPBs to separate. A likely candidate is the Clb/Cdc28-specific inhibitor Sic1, which accumulates at the restrictive temperature in mutants with temperature-sensitive alleles of the SCFCdc4 complex components such as Cdc4, Cdc34, Cdc53, and Skp1 [15], [20]. Sic1 inhibits Clb/Cdc28 kinases essential for S-phase entry [15], [20] as well as SPB separation [4], [13]. Moreover, cells that express a hyperstabilized allele of Sic1 arrest with a phenotype identical to that of cells which lack SCFCdc4 activity [49]. These findings do not, however, rule out the possibility that the destruction of additional SCFCdc4 targets, such as components of the bridge structure which physically joins newly duplicated SPBs, may be essential for SPB separation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10515</offset><text>To determine if Sic1 is the only SCFCdc4 target important for SPB separation, we deleted SIC1 in a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive CDC4 allele, cdc4-3 [19], [50], [51], and expressing GFP-tagged Spc42, a SPB component. We then asked if the ability of these mutant cells to separate SPBs at the restrictive temperature was restored. In agreement with earlier studies [20], [51], [52], we observed that an asynchronous culture of cdc4-3 cells arrests almost uniformly at the G1/S border with elongated buds, unreplicated DNA, and duplicated but unseparated SPBs 2-4 hours after being shifted to 37 C (Figure 1). In contrast, an asynchronous culture of cdc4-3 sic1Delta arrests at 37 C with a majority of cells in G2/M with large, round buds and replicated DNA, as has been observed previously [20], [52]. Most importantly, for this study, duplicated and separated SPBs were observed in the majority (&gt;90%) of cdc4-3 sic1Delta cells within 4 hours of the shift to the restrictive temperature (Figure 1). This finding indicates that the failure to separate SPBs in the absence of SCFCdc4 activity is due solely to the stabilization of Sic1 and the consequent inhibition of Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity. These results are consistent with observations made by Goh &amp; Surana who observed the formation of short spindles by immunofluorescence in asynchronous GAL-CDC4 cdc4Delta sic1Delta cells shifted to glucose to inhibit Cdc4 expression [53]. Those results were, however, inconclusive because the control cells (PGAL1-CDC4 cdc4) used in that particular study did not arrest at the G1/S border, potentially due to the persistence of a low level of Cdc4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>12159</offset><text>SIC1 deletion allows SPB separation and DNA replication in cdc4-3(ts) cells at the restrictive temperature.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12267</offset><text>(A) Spot assay showing that cdc4-3 sic1Delta cells arrest at 37 C.

Should aberrant SPB separation occur in cdc4-3 sic1 cells at the restrictive temperature, the separated SPBs may either lack half-bridges or have defective half-bridges, thus leading to subsequent delays in proliferation. We collected cdc4-3 sic1 cells during the temperature shift experiment (described above) at various times after shifting to 37 C for spotting on solid media. Plates were subsequently incubated at permissive temperature (22 C). We found that although viability decreases as cdc4-3 sic1 cells are maintained at 37 C over time, the colonies that do form show a similar range of sizes, regardless of exposure to the restrictive temperature (Figure S1A). There was also no evidence of SPB separation defects when the cdc4-3 sic1 cells taken from these colonies were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14712</offset><text>Kip1 and Cin8 are phosphorylated by Clb2/Cdc28 in vitro</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14768</offset><text>Based on existing genetic evidence in S. cerevisiae, and the finding that cyclin B/Cdk1 regulates centrosome separation in certain metazoan systems by phosphorylating the tail domain of kinesin-5 [35]-[40], we hypothesized that Clb/Cdc28 promotes SPB separation by regulating Kip1 and Cin8 function via direct phosphorylation. There are, however, six consensus CDK phosphorylation sites (S/T-P-X-X) in Kip1 and five in Cin8 (Figure 2A). Although a previous large-scale study by Ubersax et al. identified a large number of yeast proteins that are phosphorylated by Clb2/Cdc28, neither kinesin-5 was identified as a substrate [54].

Kip1 and Cin8 tagged with 12 copies of the c-Myc epitope were expressed from the GAL1 promoter in yeast cells expressing a hyperstabilized SIC1 allele (SIC1Delta3P) [49] to inhibit phosphorylation by Clb/Cdc28. We also expressed the mutants Kip16A and Cin85A, in which the serine or threonine of every consensus CDK site is mutated to non-phosphorylatable alanine. Wild-type and mutant kinesins were immunoprecipitated separately with anti-c-Myc IgG-agarose beads and then mixed with soluble Clb2/Cdc28 kinase and 32P-gamma-ATP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17188</offset><text>Both Kip1-myc12 and Cin8-myc12 were phosphorylated in a reproducible manner by Clb2/Cdc28 in vitro (Figure 2B). Furthermore, Kip16A-myc12 was, on average, almost 2-3 fold less phosphorylated compared with wild-type Kip1, whereas Cin85A-myc12 was not phosphorylated above background levels. This observation indicates that phosphorylation of Kip1 by Clb/Cdc28 can occur at sites other than the six consensus CDK sites. We also determined that the observed phosphorylation is likely to be specific to mitotic CDK complexes as a similarly prepared S-phase CDK complex, Clb5/Cdc28, did not phosphorylate either Kip1-myc12 or Cin8-myc12 to any significant extent under similar reaction conditions (Figure S2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>17895</offset><text>Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity does not regulate Kip1 and Cin8 protein abundance</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17971</offset><text>Both Kip1 and Cin8 are thought to be targeted to the proteasome by APC (anaphase promoting complex)-mediated ubiquitination [46], [47]. It has been proposed that Clb/Cdc28 controls SPB separation indirectly by regulating the in vivo stability of the Kip1 and Cin8 proteins [42], [55]. These findings were based on strains carrying either of two mutant CDC28 alleles. The first allele bears a mutation of tyrosine 19 to glutamate that mimics an inhibitory phosphorylation (cdc28Y19E) [10], [11] and the second is a conditional mutant (cdc28-as1) which is inhibited by the ATP analog, 1-NM-PP1 [48]. However, both cdc28Y19E strains, and cdc28-as1 strains (at the concentration of analog used in these studies) are still capable of DNA replication [12], [41], [48], indicating that these alleles still retain some CDK activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18796</offset><text>Hence, we determined the levels of Kip1 and Cin8 protein in strains deleted for all the B-type cyclin genes, as well as in a separate set of strains that overexpress the hyperstabilized SIC1 allele, SIC1Delta3P [49]. Phenotypic data indicate that these strains lack all Clb/Cdc28 activity as the cells are unable to either initiate DNA replication or enter mitosis [4], [20], [49], [56]. Cells were arrested in G1 with alpha-factor, and subsequently released into the appropriate medium to eliminate Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity. We observed that Kip1 (Figure 3A) and Cin8 (Figure 3B) protein levels were stable over time in the absence of Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity. In order to verify that our findings are not strain-specific, we repeated our GAL-SIC1Delta3P experiment in a W303a strain background. Just as we had observed in our own strain background, Kip1 and Cin8 protein levels did not change significantly in W303a cells lacking Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity (Figure 3). We verified that BF264-15DU and W303a GAL-SIC1Delta3P strains both arrested with unreplicated DNA and unseparated SPBs (Figure S3). Furthermore, persistent levels of Kip1 and Cin8 do not reflect de-regulated transcription, as KIP1 and CIN8 mRNAs accumulate periodically in Deltaclb1,2,3,4,5,6 mutant cells [56] (Figure 3C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>20077</offset><text>Kip1 and Cin8 protein and mRNA levels in the presence and the absence of active Clb/Cdc28 kinase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>20175</offset><text>Kip1 and Cin8 protein levels were determined by immunoblotting (see text) in three different sets of strains that were first synchronized with alpha-factor: BF264-15DU PGAL1-CLB1 Deltaclb1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 cells released into YEPG versus YEPD (top panels); wild-type BF264-15DU cells and mutants overexpressing Sic1Delta3P (GAL-SIC1Delta3P) to specifically inhibit Clb/Cdc28 (middle panels); wild-type W303a cells and mutants overexpressing Sic1Delta3P (bottom panels).

By genetic mapping, we have identified a solvent-accessible consensus CDK site (Ser 388) in the motor domain of Kip1 that is crucial to its role in SPB separation. Additionally, using a combination of mass spectrometry and genetic analysis, we have found that the phosphorylation of two consensus CDK sites in the tail domain of Kip1 is also important for timely SPB separation. Cells dependent on Kip1S388A or Kip1S1037A, T1040A as their only source of kinesin-5 are severely impaired in their ability to separate duplicated SPBs (Figure 6). Both Kip1 mutants have similar in vivo protein levels to wild-type Kip1 at 37 C and still localize to the SPBs in arrested cells (Figure S5).

Such studies may also reveal a mechanism linking phosphorylation of the kinesin-5 motor domain to that of its tail domain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>51466</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>51488</offset><text>Plasmids and DNA manipulation</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51518</offset><text>Standard methods of DNA manipulation were employed in plasmid construction and PCR.

They were subsequently arrested with alpha-factor, then released into pre-warmed (30 C) YEPG. Unlike BF264-15DU strains [89], W303a-derived strains express invertase and can thus hydrolyze sucrose to yield glucose and fructose. Therefore, we determined that YEPS is not a suitable non-inducing medium for W303a-derived strains since they can break sucrose down to form glucose which represses the GAL1-10 promoter. Instead, these strains had to first be inoculated into filter-sterilized YEPS and grown for a few hours before being shifted to YEP-raffinose (YEPR) for subsequent overnight growth.
