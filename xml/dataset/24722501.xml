Here we show that CHIP interacts and ubiquitinates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for proteasome-mediated degradation in pancreatic cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the activation of EGFR downstream pathways. CHIP suppressed cell proliferation, anchor-independent growth, invasion and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis induced by erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. The expression of CHIP was decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues or sera. Low CHIP expression in tumor tissues was correlated with tumor differentiation and shorter overall survival. These observations indicate that CHIP serves as a novel tumor suppressor by down-regulating EGFR pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, decreased expression of CHIP was associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1145</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1158</offset><text>Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States [1] with an incidence rate that is nearly equal to its mortality rate, which demonstrates the aggressiveness and lethal nature of this disease. The overall 5-year survival rate is found to be &lt;6%[2]. Locally advanced tumors with metastatic disease are often considered to be advanced pancreatic cancer with poor prognosis. Given the low overall response rates to traditional chemotherapy, novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed for this malignant disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1718</offset><text>EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is conserved and overexpressed in pancreatic cancer[3, 4]. It is a member of the ErbB family of receptors and has tyrosine kinase activity. The phosphorylation of EGFR initiates downstream signaling cascade, such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Src pathways, which have been implicated in carcinogenesis by affecting cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis[5]. EGFR over-expression is thought to confer a poor survival, correlating with a more advanced stage and the presence of metastases in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway is an attractive therapeutic target. Erlotinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively inhibits EGFR activation. A phase III study demonstrated a significant survival benefit associated with this targeted agent combined with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer [6]. However, previous reports have established that patients rapidly developed resistance, which was most likely caused by a shorter EGFR intron 1 CA repeat length [7], the mutation of KRAS[8], and the amplification of c-Met[9] in pancreatic cancer or other tumors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2891</offset><text>CHIP is a U-box dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as a chaperone for protein quality control and as a ubiquitin ligase that degrades its substrates with the help of proteasome machinery. The structure of CHIP is composed of a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR) that links to the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp90, a charged domain, and a U-box domain that is essential for E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Increased evidence showed that CHIP not only modulates misfolded proteins but also regulates pathophysiological processes. CHIP is associated with many tumor-related proteins, such as ErbB2 [10], c-Met[11], SRC-3[12], NF-kappaB[13], AKT[14], PTEN[15] and p53[16]. The up-regulation of CHIP could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and its levels were negatively correlated with the malignancy of human breast or gastric tumors. However, the exact mechanisms of CHIP in pancreatic cancer have not been elucidated to date. In the present study, we identified that EGFR, a Hsp90 client, is regulated by CHIP through ubiquitination in pancreatic cancer cells. We also investigated the functions of CHIP in pancreatic tumor progression and the significance of CHIP levels in sera or tissues of pancreatic cancer patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4113</offset><text>RESULTS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4121</offset><text>CHIP regulates EGFR levels through the Ub-Proteasome pathway in pancreatic cancer cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4210</offset><text>CHIP is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that can degrade many proteins that are related to tumor progression. We compared the levels of several tumor-related proteins in control and CHIP knockdown BxPC-3 cells by immunoblotting. We did not observe a correlation between the expression of SRC-3, ErbB-2, hTERT, PTEN, FoxO1, Bcl-2, SMAD4, c-myc, Hsp70, Hsp90 and CHIP expression in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 1A), this result could be explained by feedback of complicated signaling network in different tumor environments. Given that EGFR protein is a client of Hsp90 and is also controlled by the ubiqutination/proteasome system, we hypothesized that CHIP could be involved in the modulation of the EGFR protein level in pancreatic cancer. We first investigated the possibility that CHIP physically associates with EGFR in an endogenous or exogenous way after the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot demonstrated that endogenous EGFR and CHIP interact with each other in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 1Bi); the His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP that were both expressed after plasmid transfection in BxPC-3 cells can also interact with each other (Figure 1Bii). Then, we examined whether the amount of CHIP is involved in regulating the stability of EGFR protein. We tested the levels of EGFR and CHIP in stable CHIP knockdown (amiRNA) or in up-regulation (CHIPOE) cells, including Panc-1 and BxPC-3. CHIP knockdown resulted in an up-regulation of the steady-state levels of EGFR protein, whereas the levels of EGFR were significantly lower in CHIPOE cells compared to the control cells (Figure 1C). In the concentration-dependent experiment, our results showed that when the expression levels of exogenous Flag-CHIP increased, the levels of His-EGFR correspondingly decreased in BxPC-3 cells. This effect could be significantly accelerated by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA). On the other hand, the expression of His-EGFR did not change much after treated with MG132, moreover, the levels of EGFR that were associated with HA-ubiqutin gradually increased (Figure 1D). In the time-dependent experiment, we demonstrated that the turnover rate of EGFR increased in CHIPOE BxPC-3 cells and decreased in CHIP knockdown BxPC-3 cells compared with that in the control cells (Figure 1E). These results indicate that CHIP can associate with EGFR, recruit ubiquitin to its target protein, transfer EGFR to the proteasome and induce its degradation in pancreatic cancer cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>6695</offset><text>CHIP promotes EGFR ubiquitination for degradation through the ubiquitination/proteasome pathway</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6791</offset><text>(A) The levels of proteins that were degraded by CHIP in other types of cells were determined by immunoblotting. (B) CHIP interacts with EGFR in an endogenous or exogenous way. (i)BxPC-3 cells were pretreated with MG132 (5 muM) for 6 h, and endogenous CHIP-EGFR interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation with CHIP or EGFR antibody. (ii)BxPC-3 cells were transfected with His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP, MG132 were used after 48 h of transfection, and two exogenous protein interactions were determined by His or Flag antibody. (C) CHIP promotes EGFR degradation in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The levels of EGFR were determined after cells were infected with scrambled controls, CHIP amiRNA or CHIP overexpression(CHIPOE) lentiviruses. (D) CHIP enhances EGFR degradation in concentration and ubiquitination/proteasome dependent ways. BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin, His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP plasmids (0, 1 mug, 2 mug per well in a six-well plate). The levels of His-EGFR were determined by immunoblotting, using antibody against His-tag. Wells in another six-well plate were treated with geldanamycin (GA,1 muM) or MG132 (5 muM) for 6 h after 48 h co-transfection. The levels of His-EGFR and HA-ubiquitin were detected with anti-His or anti-HA antibody. (E) CHIP enhances EGFR degradation in a time-dependent manner. BxPC-3 cells were transfected with control,CHIPOE or CHIP amiRNA for 0, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. The levels of EGFR were determined by immunoblotting.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8266</offset><text>To determine which part of CHIP is required for the binding and down-regulation of EGFR, we created two plasmids that express the different domains of CHIP: Flag-CHIPDeltaU-box, which expresses the TPR plus charged domain of CHIP, and Flag-CHIPDeltaTPR, which expresses the U-box domain (Figure 2Ai). We found that CHIPFL as well as CHIPDeltaTPR could down-regulate the expression levels of exogenous His-EGFR, while the levels of His-EGFR did not change after CHIPDeltaU-box transfection compared to the control. On the other hand, in BxPC-3 cells that address MG132, the ubiquitins increased significantly at the location of approximately 175KDa, which is the molecular weight of EGFR after the transfection of CHIPFL or CHIPDeltaTPR (Figure 2Aii). At the same time, the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed to test the binding site of CHIP with EGFR. His-EGFR is precipitated following the Flag-CHIPFL protein, while His-EGFR could not been pulled out by either of the two truncations (Figure 2Aiii). These results raised the possibility that the full CHIP length rather than its truncations is needed for combination with EGFR, the U-box domain of CHIP can add ubiquitin to EGFR and induce its degradation through the proteasome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9499</offset><text>(A) (i)Two main functional domains of CHIP are illustrated schematically. (ii) The U-box domain of CHIP is required for degradation of EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin, His-EGFR and Flag tagged CHIP-full length (CHIPFL) or its Flag tagged domains (CHIPDeltaU-box for CHIP protein without a U-box domain, CHIPDeltaTPR for CHIP protein without a TPR domain) for 48 h. Then, the cells were treated with or without MG132 (5 muM). EGFR and ubiquitin were detected by immunoblotting with anti-His or anti-HA antibody. Anti-Flag antibody was used to test the expression of CHIPFL or its domains. (iii) CHIPFL is required to interact with EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with His-EGFR and Flag-CHIPFL, Flag-CHIPDeltaU-box or Flag-CHIPDeltaTPR for 48 h; then, the cells were treated with MG132 (5 muM). CHIP or its domains were combined by anti-Flag antibody (IP) and immunoprecipitated by A/G agarose beads. Immunoblotting (IB) using anti-His antibody was performed to determine the exogenous expression of EGFR. (B) The downstream pathways of EGFR are regulated by CHIP in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The lysate of stable CHIP knockdown cells or CHIPOE cells were used to determine the expression of AKT/mTOR, Src/FAK/paxillin,MAPK pathways by different antibodies. In the figure, p- represents phosphorylated, and t- represents total. (C) CHIP down-regulates phosphorylation of Tyr845 and Tyr 1068 of EGFR in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. (D) CHIP is co-localized with EGFR in Bxpc-3 cells and attenuates the expression of EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were transfected with vector or Flag-CHIP plasmid combined with His-EGFR plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were treated with or without EGF (50 ng/mL for 30 min) and then were stained with anti-His or anti-Flag antibody. The white arrows indicate that EGFR was present or absent due to CHIP under- or over-expression in the cytoplasm or nucleus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11389</offset><text>Furthermore, we investigate whether the downstream signaling pathways of EGFR could be modulated by CHIP. We found that the levels of phosphorylated (p-)AKT, mTOR, Bad, Src, FAK, and paxillin were higher in the stable CHIP knockdown Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells, and the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-Bad, p-Src, p-FAK, and p-paxillin significantly decreased in CHIPOE cells, while the total protein did not change in the CHIP knockdown and CHIPOE cells. The CHIP knockdown could also decrease the level of p21CIP1/WAF1. Thus, CHIP can negatively regulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Src/FAK/paxillin pathway activation in pancreatic cancer cells. We observed that CHIP can down-regulate the level of p-Erk1/2 in Bxpc-3 cells but not in panc-1 cells, suggesting that CHIP could regulate MAPK pathway but may be influenced by other factors (Figure 2B). We also tested the levels of different phosphorylated sites of EGFR in different expression of CHIP, we found that Tyr 845 and Tyr 1068 of EGFR were regulated by CHIP expression (Figure 2C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12414</offset><text>We next performed immunofluorescence to detect the effect of Flag-CHIP on His-EGFR. His-EGFR was predominantly localized to the membrane and cytoplasm in BxPC-3 cells while Flag-CHIP was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus. The expression of Flag-CHIP attenuated the His-EGFR levels. After treatment with EGF that can induce EGFR from membrane to cytoplasm and nucleus, the co-localization of EGFR and CHIP was observed in the cytoplasm, and the higher levels of Flag-CHIP were accompanied by little expression of EGFR in the nucleus (Figure 2D). These results were consistent with the EGFR-CHIP interaction detected in the immunoprecipitation assay.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13068</offset><text>Tumor growth is inhibited by CHIP in vitro and in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13124</offset><text>To examine the role of CHIP on the growth rate of pancreatic cancer cells, we performed a cell proliferation assay.

Similar results were confirmed in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 3A). In the soft agar colony formation assay, there were fewer colonies formed in the CHIPOE cells, and the knockdown of CHIP significantly increased the number of colonies compared with the control cells (Figure 3B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>13762</offset><text>CHIP effects the growth rate of pancreatic cancer cells</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13818</offset><text>(A) CHIP suppresses cell growth rate.

Tumor growth was significantly promoted in nude mice injected with CHIP knockdown cells compared with control mice (P&lt;.01), while little tumor growth was observed in the CHIPOE group compared with the control group (P&lt;.01) (Figure 3C). To further determine whether CHIP decreases the EGFR expression and inhibits tumor growth, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of CHIP, EGFR and Ki67 in nude mice tumor tissues. Histological examination revealed that CHIP is only distributed in the nucleus of the CHIP knockdown cells. CHIP protein labeling was noted in a cytoplastic and nuclear distribution in the control group, and the intensity of CHIP labeling was stronger in cytoplasm and nucleus in CHIPOE cells. EGFR protein was shown to be positive in a membranous distribution. EGFR expression was substantially down-regulated in the CHIPOE compared with the control, whereas CHIP knockdown tumor tissues showed an up-regulated expression of EGFR in the membranes. The Ki-67 protein was mainly stained in the nucleus. The percentage of cells that were strongly labeled with the Ki-67 antibody was higher in the CHIP knockdown group compared with the control group (P=.021), while the percentage of Ki67 strongly positive cells decreased with an increase in the CHIP expression (P=.026) (Figure 3D). These results suggest that CHIP suppresses tumor progression by the inhibition of EGFR expression in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16704</offset><text>CHIP enhances the sensitivity of erlotinib on apoptosis of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16802</offset><text>Because erlotinb is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR and CHIP might target EGFR for degradation, we sought to investigate the synergistic effect of CHIP and erlotinb on tumor apoptosis. We first examined the apoptotic rate of pancreatic cancer cells treated with erlotinib under different CHIP levels. Flow cytometric analysis showed a higher induction of apoptosis in CHIPOE Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells compared with the control cells. In line with this finding, the apoptotic rate decreased significantly in CHIP knockdown cells (Figure 4A). To further validate our data, we next checked the activity of caspase3/7 after treatment with erlotinib under different CHIP expressions. CHIP knockdown led to a decreased activation of caspase 3/7, while an increased activation of the caspase 3/7 was observed in CHIPOE cells after they were exposed to erlotinib (Figure 4B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>17682</offset><text>CHIP enhances the sensitivity of erlotinib on apoptosis and tumor growth</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>17755</offset><text>(A) CHIP enhances the apoptotic rate measured by FACS assay after cells were treated with erlotinib.

In contrast, the tumor growth ability in mice injected with CHIPOE cells was significantly abrogated (P&lt;.01) (Figure 4C). Immunohistochemical analysis of treated tumor xenografts of BxPC-3 cells were measured using the cleaved caspase-3 antibody. CHIP knockdown showed a decrease in the numbers of apoptotic cells, while cleaved caspases-3 labeling cells increased sharply in tissues that overexpressed CHIP (Figure 4D).

The median survival time of the patients with low CHIP expression was 12 months while a high expression of CHIP correlated with a median survival time of 40 months (Table V). Lower CHIP staining was significantly correlated with a poorer overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients (P=.0175) (Figure 6C).

Overexpression of EGFR and its persistent activation has been reported to contribute to tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer[17]. The degradation of EGFR protein relies on c-Cbl protein, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recruits ubiquitin to its substrate for degradation [18]. Until now, whether there are other ubiquitin ligases that can induce EGFR degradation remains elusive. CHIP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves as a bridge to transfer the protein from the chaperone Hsp90 to the ubiquitin-proteasome system [19]. Previous data suggested that CHIP could induce ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation in breast cancer cells [10]. EGFR, which shares close structural homology with ErbB2, has been shown to be a client of Hsp90 and has maintained stability in many cancer cells[20]. Thus, CHIP could theoretically function as a new ubiquitin ligase that can target EGFR for degradation. Our results confirmed that CHIP could interact with EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, CHIP also recruited ubiquitin to EGFR and transferred its target to the proteasome for degradation. Furthermore, CHIP accelerated the degradation of EGFR when the cells were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. This result is similar to the function of CHIP on ErbB2. Xu W et al. reported that both the CHIP and GA decrease the amount of ErbB2 associated with Hsp90, and the CHIP expression shortens the half-life of the ErbB2 protein[21].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32756</offset><text>Our study showed that CHIP induced the degradation of EGFR and inactivated its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway as well as the Src/FAK/paxillin pathways. The activation of two pathways was reported to be involved in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration in pancreatic cancer cells [22, 23]. Furthermore, MAPK pathway could also be influenced by the expression of CHIP that were observed in Bxpce-3 cells, but not in Panc-1 cells that contain mutant K-ras gene,the reason may be that MAPK signaling pathway were constitutively activated by mutation of K-ras that exhibited little response to EGFR regulation in Panc-1 cells[24]. In addition, we observed that phosphorylation of Tyr845 and Tyr1068 of EGFR was regulated by CHIP, Tyr845 of EGFR could be associated with Src and is involved in tumor malignancy or resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy [25, 26]. Phosphorylation site 1068 of EGFR forms a complex with Grb2 and increases mitogen-activated protein kinase activation [27]. In accordance with this finding, we found that CHIP knockdown enhanced the proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration of Panc-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, while CHIPOE obtained the opposite results. Moreover, tumor growth in the mouse xenografts was significantly enhanced after the injection of CHIP knockdown BxPC-3 cells, whereas the tumor growth rate was inhibited after CHIPOE cells were injected. The expression of CHIP also inhibited the number of liver metastases in nude mice. All of these results indicated that CHIP could act as a tumor suppressor that prohibits tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis in pancreatic cancer. The function of CHIP in pancreatic cancer is consistent with its role in other malignant cells. Jang KW and colleagues reported that CHIP destabilizes the Met receptor and inhibits tumor growth, motility and invasion in lung cancer cells [11]. Kajiro M et al. observed that CHIP suppresses tumor progression by direct degradation of the oncogene SRC-3 in breast cancer cells[12]. Wang S et al. reported that CHIP can down-regulate the subunit protein of NF-kappaB and inhibit gastric tumorigenesis and angiogenesis [13]. On the other hand, CHIP has been shown to enhance tumor proliferation by increasing the expression of survivin protein in human glioma cancer cells [28], which indicates that CHIP might play different roles in different human cancers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35162</offset><text>In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is highly conserved, which indicates that this tumor is responsive to EGFR target therapy. Elotinib is an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can inhibit the growth and metastasis of human pancreatic tumor xenografts [29]. Morgan et al. reported that phosphorylation of Tyr1173 of EGFR is the target of erlotinib [30],while we observed that phosphorylation of Tyr845 and Tyr1068 of EGFR could be regulated by CHIP,thus the multitarget treatment may explain the phenomena that CHIP enhanced the efficacy of erlotinib on pancreatic tumor growth and apoptosis. More importantly, CHIP could also increase the apoptotic rate induced by erlotinib in Panc-1 cells that present K-ras mutations; mutant K-ras has been viewed as a potential molecular predictor of responses to EGFR inhibition [31]. For these reasons, we thought that CHIP might be a potential treatment target for pancreatic cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36119</offset><text>In the present study, we observed that pancreatic cancer tumors exhibited a relatively lower level of CHIP expression compared with adjacent normal tissues. The expression of CHIP was correlated with tumor differentiation. Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that the reduced expression of CHIP was negatively associated with survival in pancreatic cancer patients and it was one of the independent risk factors that affected the prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. To be consistent with our results, CHIP levels have been proven to be negatively correlated with the malignancy of gastric tumor tissues [13], whereas studies on other digestive tumors obtained the opposite results. In a study on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the level of CHIP was higher in the metastatic lymph nodes compared with the primary tumors as well as in the normal esophageal epithelia. The high level of CHIP in metastatic lymph nodes was an independent prognostic factor in ESCC [32]. Liang ZL et al. reported that the high expression of CHIP indicated a significantly worse prognosis in gallbladder carcinoma patients[33]. All of these results indicate that the pathogenic mechanisms of CHIP expression in human gastrointestinal cancer are different and still require further investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37414</offset><text>Until now, there were no experiments that measured the expression of CHIP in cancer patients' sera. Our tests suggested that CHIP expression was lower in pancreatic cancer compared with healthy controls and chronic pancreatitis.

This result indicates that inflammation could affect the expression of CHIP in pancreatic tissue and serum.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37940</offset><text>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CHIP serves as a novel EGFR-mediated E3 ligase and attenuates the downstream EGFR signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells.

Sera were also obtained from 18 patients with chronic pancreatitis with a confirmed clinical diagnosis and from 47 control healthy individuals collected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The sera from the normal subject group were age- and sex-matched to the tumor group. The samples were processed using the same procedures, and 20 ml of blood was placed in the serum separator tubes. Samples were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The serum was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and then stored at -80 C. All of the serum samples were labeled with a unique marker to protect the confidentiality of the patient.

The tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were deparaffined in xylol and rehydrated using graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using a high pressure method for 3 min with citrate buffer. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to eliminated endogenous peroxidase. Quenched sections were incubated in non-immune serum for 20 min and then added with the appropriate dilution of each primary antibody (a 1:200 dilution of anti-EGFR antibody, a 1:200 dilution of anti-CHIP antibody, a 1:300 dilution of anti-Ki67 antibody or a 1:100 dilution of anti-leaved caspase-3 antibody) overnight at 4 C, followed by incubation with linked reagent for 30 min. For the negative control, the immunostaining processes were performed by using PBS as a substitute for the primary antibody. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by using diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. All of the sections were then counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols and xylol, and mounted. Slides were reviewed by light microscopy. CHIP expression in tissues was evaluated in a blinded fashion by an experienced pancreatic pathologist. Visual fields (x400 magnifications) were chosen to calculate the percentage of positively stained cells over the total number of tumor cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51688</offset><text>The staining proportion of the positive cells was divided into four groups: negative, 0 positive cells found; +, &lt;30% of tumor cells observed; ++, 30%-60% of tumor cells were immunopositive; and +++, &gt;60% of tumor cells observed.

In brief, antibody specific for human CHIP protein has been pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples were pipetted into the wells, and any CHIP proteins were bound by the immobilized antibody. After removing any unbound substances, a biotin-conjugated antibody specific for CHIP is added to the wells. After washing, avidin conjugated Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) was added to the wells. Following a wash to remove any unbound avidin-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution was added to the wells, and color develops in proportion to the amount of CHIP bound in the initial step. The color development was stopped, and the intensity of the color was measured. The measurement of each sample was tested twice. The value of 58.68 pg/ml that could differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis by Yoden index was determined as a cutoff point to measure the higher or lower expression of CHIP in serum.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>53140</offset><text>Statistical Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53160</offset><text>The values were presented as the mean +- SD.

The survival rates were calculated by the method of Kaplan-Meier. A value of P&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
