Recently, we identified p115RhoGEF, one of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho, as a direct link between Galpha13 and Rho [Kozasa, T., et al. (1998) Science 280, 2109-2111; Hart, M. J., et al. (1998) Science 280, 2112-2114]. Activated Galpha13 stimulated the RhoGEF activity of p115 through interaction with the N-terminal RGS domain. However, Galpha12 could not activate Rho through p115, although it interacted with the RGS domain of p115. The biochemical mechanism from Galpha12 to Rho activation remained unknown. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), which also contains RGS domain, with Galpha12 and Galpha13. RGS domain of LARG demonstrated Galpha12- and Galpha13-specific GAP activity. LARG synergistically stimulated SRF activation by Galpha12 and Galpha13 in HeLa cells, and the SRF activation by Galpha12-LARG was further stimulated by coexpression of Tec tyrosine kinase. It was also found that LARG is phosphorylated on tyrosine by Tec. In reconstitution assays, the RhoGEF activity of nonphosphorylated LARG was stimulated by Galpha13 but not Galpha12. However, when LARG was phosphorylated by Tec, Galpha12 effectively stimulated the RhoGEF activity of LARG. These results demonstrate the biochemical mechanism of Rho activation through Galpha12 and that the regulation of RhoGEFs by heterotrimeric G proteins G12/13 is further modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1632</offset><text>Members of the Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) regulate a variety of cellular activities such as cell-cycle progression, chemotaxis, or axonal guidance by controlling actin cytoskeletal rearrangements or gene expression (1). Activation of Rho family GTPases is catalyzed by their guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). These GEFs share a Dbl homology domain and an adjacent pleckstrin homology domain (2). The Dbl homology domain is responsible for the capacity to stimulate GDP-GTP exchange of Rho family GTPases. Except for this common Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology structure, these GEFs contain various protein motifs that are implicated in signal transduction. However, the biochemical mechanism of regulation of these GEFs by upstream signals has been poorly understood.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2429</offset><text>Heterotrimeric G proteins G12 and G13 have been shown to mediate signals from G protein-coupled receptors to Rho GTPase activation (3-5). Recently, we identified p115RhoGEF, one of GEFs for Rho, as a direct link between heterotrimeric G13 and Rho (6, 7). Activated Galpha13 stimulated the RhoGEF activity of p115 through the interaction with the N-terminal RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domain. However, Galpha12 did not activate Rho through p115 in reconstitution assays. Although the overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Galpha12 has demonstrated several evidences supporting Rho activation in cells (5, 8), the biochemical mechanism from Galpha12 to Rho activation has not been understood.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3136</offset><text>Recently, several reports indicated the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of GEF activity for Rho family GTPases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav or Vav-2 was required for their GEF activity (9, 10). GEF activity of Dbl for Rho and Cdc42 was enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation by ACK-1 (11). It was also demonstrated that several tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocked Galpha12- or Galpha13-mediated Rho activation in cells (12, 13). In addition, the involvement of Tec family tyrosine kinases in G12/13-mediated signaling pathway was demonstrated in cell-based assays as well as in in vitro experiments (14, 15). Tec kinases form a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that share pleckstrin homology and Tec homology (TH) domains at the N-terminal region (16). These kinases are activated by various stimuli, including ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (17). However, their regulatory functions in cells remain unclear.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4081</offset><text>In this study, we investigated the possibility that RhoGEF other than p115 might be responsible for mediating signals from Galpha12 to Rho.

It was shown that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG interacted with constitutively active mutants of Galpha12 and Galpha13 through their RGS domains (23, 24). However, the biochemical mechanism to regulate the RhoGEF activity of PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG by Galpha12/13 has not been elucidated. To examine whether PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG can mediate the signal from Galpha12 or Galpha13 to Rho activation, we first performed SRE-luciferase reporter assays. It has already been shown that Galpha12/13-mediated Rho activation could be monitored in cells by SRF activation (25). As shown in Fig. 1B, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Galpha12 (Galpha12Q229L) or Galpha13 (Galpha13Q226L) modestly stimulated SRF activity, whereas coexpression of these mutants with LARG or PDZ-RhoGEF synergistically potentiated SRF activation. In particular, SRF activation by PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG and Galpha12 was almost similar to the level with these RhoGEFs and Galpha13. We could not detect similar synergistic SRF activation by using p115RhoGEF in the assay. The results suggest that PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG may transduce the signal from both Galpha12 and Galpha13 to Rho activation. In this study, we focused on the function of LARG in G12/13-mediated signaling. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11694</offset><text>We examined the biochemical interaction of Galpha12/13 with LARG in vitro by using purified components. Galpha subunits and RhoGEFs were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the constructs of LARG that contain the RGS domain demonstrated GAP activity for Galpha12 or Galpha13 similar to p115RhoGEF. However, a construct of LARG lacking the RGS domain did not show any GAP activity. The RGS domain of LARG did not have GAP activity for Galphas, Galphai, Galphao, and Galphaq (data not shown). Thus, the RGS domain of LARG serves as a specific GAP for Galpha12 or Galpha13 similar to that of p115RhoGEF. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12303</offset><text>We also examined the regulation of RhoGEF activity of LARG by Galpha12/13. In the case of p115RhoGEF, Galpha13, but not Galpha12, stimulated its RhoGEF activity (7). As shown in Fig. 2C, AlF-activated Galpha13 stimulated the RhoGEF activity of LARG. However, AlF-activated Galpha12 did not demonstrate RhoGEF activation. Thus, although SRF assays suggested that Galpha12-LARG mediated Rho activation in HeLa cells, we could not reconstitute that pathway in vitro. The results suggest that additional factors or some modification on Galpha12 or LARG will be necessary for activation of Rho through the Galpha12-LARG pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12903</offset><text>Because the involvement of Tec kinase has been reported in the Galpha12-mediated pathway, we tested the possibility that Tec tyrosine kinase might be involved in Rho activation through Galpha12/13-LARG. As shown in Fig. 3A, coexpression of Tec kinase in HeLa cells potently stimulated both Galpha12- and Galpha13-LARG-mediated SRF activation. However, we did not observe a similar effect of Tec when Galpha12/13 or LARG was expressed alone. Coexpression of Tec did not stimulate SRF activation mediated by Galpha12/13-p115RhoGEF (data not shown). In addition, a kinase-deficient mutant of Tec (Tec-KD) failed to stimulate the Galpha12/13-LARG-mediated SRF activation. GTP-bound Rho pull-down assay also demonstrated that Rho activation by Galpha12-LARG in HeLa cells was further stimulated by Tec (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Tec tyrosine kinase regulates Galpha12/13-LARG-mediated Rho activation by phosphorylating some component of the pathway. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13833</offset><text>The interaction of Galpha12 with Btk, another member of the Tec family, through its pleckstrin homology-TH domain was recently demonstrated (15). As shown in Fig. 3C, we could also observe the interaction between constitutively active Galpha12QL and Tec by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, a Tec construct lacking TH domain did not show the stimulatory effect on Galpha12-LARG-mediated SRF activation, indicating that the TH domain of Tec is required for its effect on the Galpha12/13-LARG pathway (Fig. 3D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14335</offset><text>We next examined whether Tec can directly phosphorylate Galpha12/13 or LARG. Myc-tagged Tec was overexpressed in COS1 cells, immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody, and used for in vitro phosphorylation assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, DeltaPDZ-LARG was phosphorylated on tyrosine by Tec. However, p115RhoGEF, Galpha12, or Galpha13 did not serve as a substrate for Tec. Moreover, the activated Galpha12 or Galpha13 did not affect the phosphorylation of LARG by Tec. We also examined tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG in cells. A Tec construct with an N-terminal myristoylation signal (mHTec) was targeted to the plasma membrane and exhibited constitutive activity (19). As shown in Fig. 4B, DeltaPDZ-LARG, but not p115, was tyrosine phosphorylated in HEK293 cells when coexpressed with mHTec. However, we could not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of DeltaN-LARG under the same condition. These results suggest that Tec phosphorylates LARG in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, the phosphorylation site on LARG is likely in the region including its RGS domain (amino acid residues 307-617 of LARG). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15412</offset><text>Finally, we examined the effect of phosphorylation of LARG on its RhoGEF activity (Fig. 4C and D). LARG was first phosphorylated by preincubation with Tec, and then RhoGEF assays were started by adding RhoA and Galpha subunits. The preincubation with Tec did not affect the basal RhoGEF activity of LARG. However, Galpha12 stimulated the RhoGEF activity of LARG in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This stimulation was almost similar to the level by Galpha13 without Tec. The stimulatory effect by Galpha12 was also dependent on the presence of ATP during preincubation (data not shown), confirming that the phosphorylation of LARG is required for Galpha12 to activate Rho. These results indicate that Galpha12 can activate Rho through phosphorylated LARG. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG also modestly stimulated RhoGEF activity mediated by Galpha13 (Fig. 4D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>16257</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16268</offset><text>The results of this study demonstrated the biochemical mechanism of Rho activation through Galpha12. Although Galpha12 and Galpha13 are similar in amino acid sequences and biochemical properties and both are involved in Rho activation, several studies indicated the functional differences between these two Galpha subunits. The most striking difference was demonstrated in Galpha13 gene knockout mice, which showed embryonic lethality due to the defect of vascular system formation (26). Galpha12 could not rescue the function of Galpha13 in these mice. In reconstitution experiments, Galpha13 stimulated the GEF activity of p115RhoGEF. However, Galpha12 could not stimulate the GEF activity of p115 and competitively inhibited the stimulatory effect of Galpha13 (7). In this report, we demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG is required for Galpha12 to activate Rho. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG could further stimulate the effect of Galpha13, it was not required for Rho activation by Galpha13. These differences in the regulatory mechanisms of Galpha12- and Galpha13-mediated pathways may be responsible for the different cellular effects induced by Galpha12 or Galpha13.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17421</offset><text>Because the TH domain was required for Tec to stimulate Galpha12-LARG-mediated SRF activation, this domain may be involved in the interaction with Galpha12 similar to the case of Btk. However, we could not detect the activation of Tec kinase by Galpha12 in vitro (data not shown). The exact mechanism of Galpha12 to regulate Tec kinase is currently unclear. However, it is interesting to note that thrombin, which can activate the Galpha12/13 pathway, has also been reported to activate Tec in platelets (17). It is possible that activated Galpha12 may recruit Tec in close proximity of LARG and facilitate the phosphorylation of LARG. Tec is also activated by other stimuli, such as cytokines and growth factors. These signaling pathways will also be able to regulate the Galpha12-LARG pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18196</offset><text>In addition to Tec, the involvement of Pyk2 in the G12/13-RhoGEF pathway has been reported (27). Furthermore, Chikumi et al. (28) recently demonstrated that thrombin stimulation activated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FAK in HEK293 cells and that activated FAK could phosphorylate PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG but not p115RhoGEF. They also demonstrated the enhancement of Rho activation by coexpression of activated FAK and PDZ-RhoGEF in cells. They proposed that tyrosine phosphorylation of PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG by FAK might be involved in the activation of Rho. However, its biochemical mechanism remained unclear. We demonstrated here that tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG by Tec does not affect its basal RhoGEF activity, but rather changes its regulation by Galpha subunits. It is possible that the activity of PDZ-RhoGEF is also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. The modulation of the Galpha12/13-RhoGEF pathway by tyrosine kinases may be a widely used mechanism for G protein-coupled receptor-mediated Rho activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>19206</offset><text>Figures and Tables</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>19225</offset><text>Involvement of LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF in Galpha12/13-mediated SRF activation.
