Disturbances in ERAD are linked to ER stress, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases. However, the composition and organization of ERAD complexes in human cells is still poorly understood. In this paper, we describe a trimeric complex that we propose functions in ERAD. Knockdown of erasin, a platform for p97/VCP and ubiquilin binding, or knockdown of ubiquilin in human cells slowed degradation of two classical ERAD substrates. In Caenorhabditis elegans, ubiquilin and erasin are ER stress-response genes that are regulated by the ire-1 branch of the unfolded protein response pathway. Loss of ubiquilin or erasin resulted in activation of ER stress, increased accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and shortened lifespan in worms. Our results strongly support a role for this complex in ERAD and in the regulation of ER stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1253</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1266</offset><text>The ER is a fundamental eukaryotic organelle where proteins are made and where stringent quality-control systems operate to ensure that only correctly folded and properly assembled protein complexes are allowed to exit the organelle for delivery to their intended sites of function (Ellgaard et al., 1999; Kostova and Wolf, 2003; Hebert and Molinari, 2007). The mechanisms by which the ER operates to monitor and dispose of misfolded and misassembled protein complexes are beginning to be understood. One mechanism is ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), a regulated process by which proteins in the ER are exported to the cytoplasm for destruction by the proteasome (Kanehara et al., 2007; Vembar and Brodsky, 2008; Hirsch et al., 2009). Inefficient clearance of misfolded and misassembled proteins from the ER leads to ER stress, which results in the activation of a signaling cascade called the unfolded protein response (UPR; Schroder and Kaufman, 2005; Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007; Ron and Walter, 2007). In mammals, UPR is regulated by three main sensors called IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, each of which triggers, via distinct mechanisms, a coordinated intracellular response designed to restore protein homeostasis in the ER. If, however, ER stress is not alleviated, a terminal cell death program is then executed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2588</offset><text>There is growing evidence that disturbances in ERAD are involved in human disease. For example, several diseases appear to result from mutations in proteins that cause them to misfold in the ER during synthesis, where they are retained and eliminated by ERAD (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005; Zhao and Ackerman, 2006; Brodsky, 2007). Although in this scenario, ERAD is detrimental and leads to disease, under normal circumstances, it presumably functions as a safety mechanism to remove damaged and misassembled proteins before they accumulate to toxic levels. However, inefficient ERAD has also been linked to disease. For example, mutant proteins involved in Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were recently shown to induce ER stress by interfering with ERAD (Nishitoh et al., 2008; Duennwald and Lindquist, 2008).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3421</offset><text>Our knowledge of proteins involved in ERAD is expanding (for reviews see Kanehara et al., 2007; Vembar and Brodsky, 2008; Hirsch et al., 2009). Derlin proteins are thought to form the portal in the ER through which misfolded and misassembled proteins are exported. p97 (valosin-containing protein: p97/VCP) provides the main driving force for extraction of the ERAD substrate (Lilley and Ploegh 2004; Ye et al., 2004). p97/VCP is recruited to the ER for ERAD by binding to ER-localized proteins, candidates of which are gp78, derlin, VIMP, ubx2, Hrd1, erasin, and UBXD8. During extraction, the misfolded protein is tagged with a polyubiquitin chain by ubiquitin ligases (Kostova et al., 2007); the polyubiquitin chain serves as a signal for the recognition and destruction of the protein by the proteasome. At least five ER resident ubiquitin ligases:Hrd1/Der3, gp78, Doa10/Teb4, RMA1, and RFP2:conduct this modification, although others probably exist. The length of the ubiquitin chain that is tagged onto substrates is regulated by Ufd2, which is recruited to the ERAD complex by binding to p97/VCP (Richly et al., 2005). Ufd2, in turn, binds two additional factors, Rad23 and Dsk2, both of which contain ubiquitin-associated (UBA) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains, which appear to function in the transfer of the ubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome for degradation (Richly et al., 2005; Elsasser and Finley, 2005). The UBA domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 bind polyubiquitin chains, and their UBL domains bind the proteasome, thus positioning these ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle proteins as the terminal factors that deliver the substrate to the proteasome for degradation (Verma et al., 2004; Raasi and Wolf, 2007).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5146</offset><text>Many of the ERAD components mentioned were first identified in yeast. Interestingly, mammals contain additional ERAD components for which no counterparts exist in yeast, which suggests that mammals use a more elaborate repertoire of proteins in ERAD (Carvalho et al., 2006; Jentsch and Rumpf, 2007; Kanehara et al., 2007).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5469</offset><text>In this paper, we demonstrate that human ubiquilin proteins (Wu et al., 1999; Mah et al., 2000; Kleijnen et al., 2000) that are found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (Mah et al., 2000), and which are believed to function as ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factors, interact with erasin, an ER localized protein (Liang et al., 2006), in a novel complex that functions in ERAD.

In these experiments, purified GST-ubiquilin or GST-His protein alone, which served as a control for nonspecific binding, were mixed with purified p97/VCP-His, erasin-His, or both p97/VCP-His and erasin-His proteins, and then the GST proteins were affinity purified. The purified complexes were examined by immunoblotting for recovery of the added His-tagged proteins (Fig. 1 F). The blots show that erasin-His bound strongly to GST-ubiquilin but not to GST alone. Also, p97/VCP-His was isolated in a complex with GST-ubiquilin, but only after addition of erasin-His. These results strongly suggest that p97/VCP binds ubiquilin through erasin and that all three proteins coexist in a single complex. Quantification of the stoichiometry of the complex suggests that erasin-His and p97/VCP-His bind GST-ubiquilin in an ~1:1 ratio (see Fig. S2). Because p97/VCP self-assembles to form a homohexamer, it is likely that in these in vitro binding assays, erasin has saturated each of the six UBX-binding sites of the p97/VCP hexamer (Meyer et al., 2000; Dreveny et al., 2004).</text><annotation id="11"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="9475" length="266"/><text>In these experiments, purified GST-ubiquilin or GST-His protein alone, which served as a control for nonspecific binding, were mixed with purified p97/VCP-His, erasin-His, or both p97/VCP-His and erasin-His proteins, and then the GST proteins were affinity purified.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10548</offset><text>Erasin, ubiquilin, and p97/VCP coimmunoprecipitate with each other in cells</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10624</offset><text>To determine if erasin, ubiquilin, and p97/VCP form a complex in cells, we immunoprecipitated each of the proteins from HEK293 cells and found that the other two proteins were indeed coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 A, lane 2; and Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 5).

We reasoned that erasin might recruit p97/VCP and ubiquilin to the ER during ERAD for separate purposes: p97/VCP to aid in the retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates from the ER, whereas ubiquilin might function to bridge binding of the extracted ubiquitinated substrate and the proteasome through interaction with its UBA and UBL domains, respectively. To test this idea, we made a comparison to see if assembly of the complex was altered in cells treated with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We predicted that proteasome inhibition would lead to a buildup of the complex in cells because of the inability of ubiquilin to deliver the ERAD substrate to the proteasome for degradation. Indeed, more ubiquilin was coimmunoprecipitated with erasin or p97/VCP proteins, or vice versa, in cells cultured in the presence of MG132 than in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, more alpha6 subunit components of the proteasome and ubiquitinated proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with ubiquilin, erasin, and p97/VCP proteins after proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the amount of p97/VCP or erasin proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with each other was not altered after proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B), which indicates that association of ubiquilin, but not p97/VCP, with erasin is regulated by proteasome activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14003</offset><text>To explore the interaction between ubiquilin and erasin further, we examined whether overexpression of either protein affects assembly of the complex.

However, overexpression of ubiquilin-1 increased the amount of ubiquilin-1, but not p97/VCP, that coimmunoprecipitated with erasin (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were found upon repetition of the experiments with cells treated with MG132: binding of ubiquilin to erasin was sensitive to both proteasome inhibition and ubiquilin expression (Fig. 2 A, last four lanes).

We monitored ubiquilin binding at the ER by fractionating homogenates of cells in which we either artificially induced, or did not induce, ERAD on density gradients (Fig. 3 A). The ER fractionated mainly across the middle-to-heavy-density portions of the gradients, as revealed by the distribution of calnexin, a classical ER marker (Fig. 3 A). Erasin cofractionated with calnexin, as expected. In untreated HEK293 cells, only a faint amount of ubiquilin cofractionated with erasin, with the vast majority of the protein located in lower density end of the gradient (Fig. 3, A and F). In contrast, MG132 treatment increased migration of ubiquilin toward the ER-containing fractions, which were also enriched for ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3, B and F). Similarly, overexpression of the ERAD substrates CD3delta, a membrane-bound protein, or alpha1-anti-trypsin null Hong Kong mutant (alpha1ATNHK), a misfolded luminal protein, also promoted migration of ubiquilin to the ER fractions (Fig. 3, C, D, and F). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type alpha1AT, which is not misfolded and should not be a target for ERAD, did not promote migration of ubiquilin to the ER (Fig. 3, D and F). Treatment of cells with tunicamycin, which causes protein misfolding and increased ERAD, also promoted ubiquilin migration to the ER (Fig. 3, E and F).

The erasin mutants selected were chosen based on their in vitro ubiquilin-binding properties (Fig. S1). We selected erasin fragments 1-310 aa and 1-168 aa as putative dominant-negative candidates because they both bound ubiquilin-1 but are not targeted to the ER (Liang et al., 2006), and erasin fragment 414-508 aa as an ineffective mutant because it was devoid of ubiquilin-1 binding. We compared the rate of turnover of CD3delta, stably expressed in HEK293 cells, after overexpression of the mutant constructs. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), erasin fragments 1-310 and 1-168 both slowed the turnover of CD3delta, but the 414-508 fragment had little effect.

These findings, together with the known functions of the proteins with which erasin coimmunoprecipitates, have enabled us to construct a model of how the complex might function in ERAD. Specifically, we propose that misfolded protein substrates that are extracted from the ER interact sequentially with a series of proteins and are eventually delivered to the terminal degradation apparatus of the cell, the proteasome (Fig. 10). The model we propose predicts that delivery of ER-derived substrates to the proteasome is highly coupled in a manner that prevents premature release of the substrate into the cytosol, where it might accumulate or aggregate into a potentially toxic species.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>38910</offset><text>Model of the mammalian erasin-assembled ERAD complex.

We propose that erasin forms a complex with derlin and gp78/Hrd1 ligases either through direct or indirect interaction of the proteins, which is supported by coprecipitation of the proteins (Liang et al., 2006; Mueller et al., 2008). Erasin recruits p97/VCP to the complex via direct interaction with its UBX domain (Fig. 10 B; Liang et al., 2006). On the basis of previous studies of the mechanism by which ERAD is thought to occur (Ye et al., 2001; Jarosch et al., 2002; Vembar and Brodsky, 2008), we propose that the misfolded substrate in the ER is polyubiquitinated by gp78/Hrd1 and/or related ubiquitin ligases and extracted through the derlin channel by p97/VCP (Fig. 10 B). We speculate that the polyubiquitin chain that is conjugated onto the substrate is then recognized by the UBA domain of ubiquilin, which promotes ubiquilin binding to erasin, or vice versa (Fig. 10 B). Ubiquilin in turn recruits the proteasome to the ERAD complex, probably via interactions with its UBL domain, bringing it in close proximity for the delivery and degradation of the ERAD substrate that is anchored to the UBA domain of ubiquilin (Fig. 10, C and D). After degradation of the substrate, we speculate that the complex most likely disassembles. The model incorporates many of our results with the well-established functions of the proteins mentioned.

Yet according to immunoprecipitation studies, we noticed differences in the amount of the proteins that were bound to erasin under different conditions: the amount of p97/VCP that was bound to erasin was dependent on the amount of erasin protein expressed, whereas ubiquilin binding to erasin was stimulated by either overexpression of ubiquilin itself, by proteasome inhibition, or by enhancing ERAD. On the basis of these results, we suggest that binding of p97/VCP to erasin is governed principally by the amount of erasin in cells, whereas binding of ubiquilin to erasin is transitory, and might only occur during delivery of the polyubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome for degradation.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that ubiquilin first interacts with erasin, and then with the polyubiquitinated substrate. Both mechanisms are supported by in vitro binding studies. For example, we found that ubiquilin binds erasin with very high affinity (with a KD of 30 nm; Fig. S4). Also, the UBA domain of ubiquilin binds a wide variety of ubiquitin moieties with similar high affinity, including K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin that is principally conjugated onto proteins that are degraded by proteasomes (Ko et al., 2004; Massey et al., 2004; Raasi et al., 2005).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42889</offset><text>In the next step of our model, we propose that erasin-bound ubiquilin recruits proteasomes to the complex, probably via interaction of its UBL domain with subunits of the proteasome.

In support of such a mechanism, we found that silencing of ubiquilin expression abrogated proteasome recruitment to the erasin complex. Furthermore, silencing of erasin expression led to a similar outcome, which is expected because erasin serves to recruit ubiquilin to the complex.

UPR induction of both erasin and ubiquilin genes in C. elegans appeared to be under the control of ire-1. The ire-1-dependent regulation of erasin and ubiquilin expression is in accord with previous studies indicating that this arm of the UPR is principally involved in regulating expression of ERAD components (Travers et al., 2000).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45980</offset><text>Our finding, that erasin and ubiquilin are induced by ER stress, might help explain the increased staining of the proteins found in brains of individuals afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (AD; Mah et al., 2000; Liang et al., 2006). The simplest explanation is that ER stress is involved in AD pathogenesis. Obviously, this remains speculative, but it is consistent with the observation that UPR markers are activated AD (Hamos et al., 1991; Hoozemans et al., 2005). In fact, ER stress has now been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease (Nishitoh et al., 2008; Duennwald and Lindquist, 2008). It is worth noting that in the case of Huntington's disease, overexpression of ubiquilin, which we now show here promotes ERAD, suppresses the toxicity of expanded polyglutamine proteins in cell and animal models of the disease (Wang et al., 2006).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46891</offset><text>We found that reduction of ubiquilin or erasin expression shortened the life span of worms, which suggests that they are important for normal survival.
