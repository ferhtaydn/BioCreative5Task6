This, in turn, recruits and activates cytosolic effectors with PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, thereby controlling important cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, or chemotaxis. The class IB p110gamma/p101 PI3Kgamma is activated by Gbetagamma on stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. It is currently unknown whether in living cells Gbetagamma acts as a membrane anchor or an allosteric activator of PI3Kgamma, and which role its noncatalytic p101 subunit plays in its activation by Gbetagamma. Using GFP-tagged PI3Kgamma subunits expressed in HEK cells, we show that Gbetagamma recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its p101 subunit. Accordingly, p101 was found to be required for G protein-mediated activation of PI3Kgamma in living cells, as assessed by use of GFP-tagged PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-binding PH domains. Furthermore, membrane-targeted p110gamma displayed basal enzymatic activity, but was further stimulated by Gbetagamma, even in the absence of p101. Therefore, we conclude that in vivo, Gbetagamma activates PI3Kgamma by a mechanism assigning specific roles for both PI3Kgamma subunits, i.e., membrane recruitment is mediated via the noncatalytic p101 subunit, and direct stimulation of Gbetagamma with p110gamma contributes to activation of PI3Kgamma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1534</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1547</offset><text>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks)* phosphorylate the D3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, thereby generating intracellular signaling molecules (Stephens et al., 1993; Fruman et al., 1998). These phospholipids, i.e., phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, have been implicated in cellular functions including chemotaxis, differentiation, glucose homeostasis, proliferation, survival, and trafficking (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001; Cantley, 2002). They transmit signals by recruiting effector molecules that possess specific lipid-binding domains. FYVE domains and PX domains bind to PtdIns-3-P with high affinity, whereas a subgroup of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, containing a highly basic motif, preferentially binds PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Hurley and Misra, 2000; Simonsen et al., 2001; Wishart et al., 2001).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2425</offset><text>PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 represents the major product of class I PI3Ks in vivo. These lipid kinases are under tight control of cell surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR; Katso et al., 2001). All class I members are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic and a p85- or p101-type noncatalytic subunit. The class IA p110 isoforms alpha, beta, and delta form a complex with p85 adaptor subunits, whereas the only class IB member (p110gamma) is associated with a p101 noncatalytic subunit. The p85 subunit binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated RTKs. This interaction has two consequences resulting in activation of the PI3K. First, the cytosolic enzyme translocates to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, giving p110 access to its lipid substrate (Gillham et al., 1999). Second, the interaction with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor induces a conformational change of p85 that results in disinhibition of p110 enzymatic activity (Yu et al., 1998). Because the p85 regulatory subunit inhibits the p110 catalytic subunit, it is feasible that constitutively membrane-associated class IA p110 mutants trigger downstream responses characteristic of growth factor action (Klippel et al., 1996).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3662</offset><text>Similar to class IA PI3Ks, unstimulated PI3Kgamma is predominantly localized in the cytosol, whereas GPCRs induced an increase of PI3Kgamma in the membrane fraction (Al-Aoukaty et al., 1999; Naccache et al., 2000). GPCRs activate PI3Kgamma through direct interaction with Gbetagamma, whereas a stimulation by Galpha is quantitatively less important (Stoyanov et al., 1995; Stephens et al., 1997; Leopoldt et al., 1998). However, little is known about the activating mechanism, e.g., it remains elusive whether Gbetagamma functions as a membrane anchor or an allosteric regulator of PI3Kgamma. Although the p101 subunit has been proposed to act as an indispensable adaptor linking Gbetagamma with p110gamma (Stephens et al., 1997), in vitro studies have suggested that p101 is not mandatory for Gbetagamma-induced stimulation of PI3Kgamma (Stoyanov et al., 1995). Moreover, a direct interaction of Gbetagamma with NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of p110gamma has been demonstrated (Leopoldt et al., 1998). Further support for a direct interaction of Gbetagamma with the p110 catalytic subunit came from the observation that the p110beta isoform can also be stimulated by Gbetagamma, regardless of whether p85 is present or not (Kurosu et al., 1997; Maier et al., 1999, 2000). Nevertheless, the noncatalytic p101 subunit of PI3Kgamma binds tightly to Gbetagamma, suggesting specific roles in G protein-induced regulation of this lipid kinase. For instance, in vitro studies showed that Gbetagamma-stimulated p110gamma potently produced PtdIns-3-P, whereas the Gbetagamma-activated heterodimeric p110gamma/p101 counterpart potently catalyzed the formation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Maier et al., 1999). This suggests that p101 may affect the interaction of Gbetagamma-stimulated p110gamma with the lipid interface.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5376</offset><text>Therefore, the exact roles of Gbetagamma and PI3Kgamma subunits in G protein-induced activation of PI3Kgamma in living cells remain unclear.

The same distribution was seen for YFP-tagged p101 coexpressed with wild-type p110gamma (Fig. 2 B, bottom). Thus, fluorescent PI3Kgamma subunits form heterodimers (see next section), present in the cytosol and nucleus of HEK cells, whereas distribution of the p110gamma subunit alone seems restricted to the cytosol.

The expression level of p110gamma correlated with the amount of the p110gamma (but not the p101) plasmid. In contrast, the expression level of p101 was also dependent on the amount of the p110gamma plasmid. Hence, the stability of p101 depends on the coexpression of p110gamma, but not vice versa. The poor cytosolic fluorescence of YFP-tagged p101 in the absence of p110gamma may thus be explained by cytosolic degradation of monomeric p101.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10165</offset><text>In vivo dimerization of PI3Kgamma subunits</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10205</offset><text>To directly demonstrate heterodimerization of PI3Kgamma subunits in living cells, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).

However, the different FRET efficiencies may also reflect different degrees of heterodimerization. To exclude the latter, we analyzed heterodimerization of different p101/p110gamma combinations by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3 B). The elution profile of YFP-p110gamma (Fig. 3 B, bottom) was completely shifted to earlier fractions on coexpression with CFP-p101 (Fig. 3 B, top), indicating a high degree of heterodimerization. A similar elution profile was found for p110gamma-YFP + CFP-p101 (Fig. 3 B, middle), albeit a lower FRET efficiency was detected for this combination. Hence, the different FRET efficiencies observed are not due to different degrees of dimerization, but likely reflect different distances of the fluorescent tags in the p101/p110gamma heterodimer.

Therefore, we asked whether overexpression of free Gbetagamma directs YFP-fused PI3Kgamma subunits to the cell membrane in vivo. Surprisingly, p110gamma was not membrane-localized in the presence of coexpressed Gbetagamma in HEK cells (Fig. 4 A, top). In contrast, Gbetagamma recruited p101 to the membrane, resulting in accumulation of NH2- or COOH-terminally YFP-tagged p101 at both plasma- and endomembranes (Fig. 4 A, bottom, and Fig. 4 B).

In cells coexpressing the fMLP receptor and heterodimeric PI3Kgamma, fMLP stimulation induced a rapid membrane translocation of GFP-GRP1PH (Fig. 5 B, third panel), indicating that this effect indeed reflects fMLP receptor-mediated stimulation of PI3Kgamma. Accordingly, the fMLP-induced effect was sensitive to pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX; unpublished data). Interestingly, a slight basal membrane localization of GFP-GRP1PH was visible in the cells coexpressing heterodimeric PI3Kgamma and the fMLP receptor even in the absence of agonist (Fig. 5 B, third panel).

Vice versa, Gbetagamma behaves as a membrane anchor recruiting PI3Kgamma through association with p101. So far, these experiments did not clarify whether membrane recruitment itself is sufficient for activation of the enzyme or whether additional allosteric stimulation is required. To tackle this question, we generated p110gamma mutants containing a COOH-terminal isoprenylation signal, i.e., a CAAX-box motif, which constitutively localizes p110gamma to the plasma membrane. p110gamma-CAAX accumulated at the plasma membrane of HEK cells, and was able to complex with p101 (Fig. 6, top). Coexpression of Gbetagamma together with YFP-p110gamma-CAAX increased not only fluorescent staining of endomembranes, but also produced a wortmannin-sensitive rounding of the cells (Fig. 6, bottom) even in the absence of p101 (not depicted), which was similar to the effect after coexpression of Gbetagamma with p110gamma/p101 dimers (see Fig. 4 C). These observations imply that membrane-bound PI3Kgamma is not fully active, but can be further activated by Gbetagamma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>22333</offset><text>Characterization of a constitutively membrane-associated p110gamma-CAAX.

A slight basal membrane localization of the fluorescent PH domain was evident on coexpression with p110gamma-CAAX (Fig. 7 A, top panel) indicating an elevated PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 level. The same picture emerged when p101 was present in the panel of transfected plasmids (Fig. 7 A, second panel). On coexpression of the receptor, fMLP induced a significant additional translocation of GFP-GRP1PH from the cytosol to the membrane (Fig. 7 A, third and fourth panel) indicating additional stimulation of the membrane-bound lipid kinase. Interestingly, the effect was similar irrespective of whether p101 was present or not, suggesting direct activation of monomeric p110gamma. PTX sensitivity confirmed that fMLP-induced activation of p110gamma-CAAX was mediated by Gi proteins (unpublished data). Because Gbetagamma can activate Ras, which in turn may activate p110gamma, one may imagine that fMLP-induced, p101-independent stimulation of p110gamma-CAAX was mediated by Ras. However, coexpression of dominant-negative Ras N17 had no effect on fMLP-induced p110gamma-CAAX stimulation, whereas its inhibitory effect was evident when EGF-induced MAP kinase activation was assessed (Fig. 7 A, bottom panel). In addition, an indirect autocrine stimulatory effect was excluded because supernatants of fMLP-stimulated cells failed to induce GFP-GRP1PH translocation in cells omitting fMLP receptors (unpublished data).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24331</offset><text>Activation of a constitutively membrane-associated p110gamma-CAAX.

In resting cells, fluorescent PI3Kgamma was predominantly detected in the cytosol. This resembles the native situation in which the vast majority of the endogenous PI3Kgamma pool has been assigned to the cytosol (Stephens et al., 1994, 1997; Tang and Downes, 1997).

However, the structure of p101 and the molecular determinants for the interaction of both PI3Kgamma subunits are currently unknown. In vitro data derived from p101 and p110gamma deletion mutants suggest that large areas of p101 may interact with the NH2-terminal side of p110gamma (Krugmann et al., 1999). FRET data presented here indicate that NH2 and both COOH termini of p110gamma and p101 are in close proximity. The latter finding is of interest because the p110gamma COOH terminus harbors the catalytic domain. Previous data have implied that not only Ras (Pacold et al., 2000), but also Gbetagamma (Leopoldt et al., 1998) directly interact with the COOH terminus of p110gamma. Therefore, interaction of p101 with the catalytic domain of p110gamma would be in line with the functional data suggesting that p101 affects interaction of Gbetagamma-stimulated p110gamma with the lipid interface (Maier et al., 1999).</text><annotation id="9"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0055</infon><location offset="28411" length="110"/><text>FRET data presented here indicate that NH2 and both COOH termini of p110gamma and p101 are in close proximity.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28984</offset><text>Gbetagamma is considered to be the principal, direct stimulus of GPCR-induced PI3Kgamma enzymatic activity. Convincing evidence for this assumption has come from reconstitution of purified proteins, demonstrating that in vitro, the enzymatic activity of heterodimeric and monomeric PI3Kgamma is significantly stimulated by Gbetagamma (Stoyanov et al., 1995; Stephens et al., 1997; Tang and Downes, 1997; Leopoldt et al., 1998). However, when we challenged the concept in living cells, marked differences in the sensitivities between heterodimeric and monomeric PI3Kgamma emerged. The G protein-coupled fMLP receptor activated p110gamma/p101, but not p110gamma, as evident from the translocation of fluorescent PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 sensors or the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation. Likewise, coexpressed Gbetagamma recruited p110gamma/p101, but not p110gamma, to membranes of HEK cells. Interestingly, PI3Kbeta, another Gbetagamma-regulated PI3K, did not translocate to the membrane on GPCRs or Gbetagamma stimulation, whereas RTKs induced membrane recruitment in vivo (unpublished data).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30022</offset><text>Does membrane recruitment of PI3Kgamma by itself result in constitutive activation of p110gamma? To answer this intriguing question, we used an isoprenylated mutant of p110gamma, i.e., p110gamma-CAAX, which is permanently attached to the membrane, and thereby, is in close proximity to its lipid substrates. Expression of p110gamma-CAAX only slightly enhanced membrane association of fluorescent PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 sensors in HEK or VSM cells. Notably, it did not affect the morphology of HEK cells. In contrast, coexpression of Gbetagamma together with p110gamma-CAAX induced morphological changes comparable to cells transfected with plasmids encoding Gbetagamma and p110gamma/p101. Furthermore, stimulation of the cells with fMLP stimulated Akt phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of PH domains regardless of whether p110gamma/p101 or p110gamma-CAAX was the effector. This establishes a second role for Gbetagamma, i.e., the activation of the membrane-attached catalytic p110gamma subunit even in the absence of p101 (Fig. 9). Although Gbetagamma interacts with either monomeric PI3Kgamma subunit through individual binding sites, it does not exclude the possibility that heterodimeric PI3Kgamma forms either a common or different binding site(s) for Gbetagamma. Attempts to determine the stoichiometry of the interaction between heterodimeric PI3Kgamma and one or more Gbetagamma were inconclusive. One possible reason may be a weak affinity between p110gamma and Gbetagamma, whereas p101 binds at least with moderate affinity to Gbetagamma as determined by copurification studies (Stephens et al., 1997; Krugmann et al., 1999; Maier et al., 1999) and by a Biacore plasmon resonance approach (unpublished data).</text><annotation id="10"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><infon key="PSIMI">0096</infon><location offset="31427" length="312"/><text>One possible reason may be a weak affinity between p110gamma and Gbetagamma, whereas p101 binds at least with moderate affinity to Gbetagamma as determined by copurification studies (Stephens et al., 1997; Krugmann et al., 1999; Maier et al., 1999) and by a Biacore plasmon resonance approach (unpublished data).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>31658</offset><text>Hypothetical model for receptor- induced membrane recruitment and activation of heterodimeric PI3Kgamma. fMLP receptor, a prototypical heptahelical receptor coupled to Gi proteins. PI3Kgamma; the cytosolic enzyme consists of a noncatalytic p101 subunit, which is in a tight complex with p110gamma, thereby stabilizing p101. The NH2 and COOH termini of p101 and p110gamma are oriented in close proximity, respectively. Contact sites involve the NH2 termini of both subunits. The modular domain structure of p110gamma (RBD, Ras binding domain; C2, C2 domain; hel, helical domain; N-cat, C-cat, NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of the catalytic domain) is based on the crystal structure of an NH2-terminally truncated p110gamma. (A) Membrane recruitment. The agonist-stimulated receptor induces the release of Gbetagamma from Gi proteins (dotted arrow). Gbetagamma recruits the PI3Kgamma heterodimer to the plasma membrane (dotted arrow) by binding to the noncatalytic p101 (hollow arrow). Accordingly, Gbetagamma and p101 function as a membrane anchor and an adaptor for PI3Kgamma, respectively. In addition, the C2 domain of p110gamma may facilitate membrane attachment through interaction with phospholipids. p101 may also affect the interaction of PI3Kgamma with the lipid interface. Membrane-attached PI3Kgamma exhibits basal enzymatic activity. (B) Allosteric activation. At the membrane, Gbetagamma activates PI3Kgamma by direct interaction with p110gamma (hollow arrows). This stimulation does not require p101. However, p101 may participate in Gbetagamma-induced stimulation of membrane-attached p110gamma. The stoichiometry of the Gbetagamma-PI3Kgamma interaction is unknown, i.e., Gbetagamma may interact with p101 and p110gamma through individual or common binding sites. Gbetagamma binds to the NH2- and COOH-terminal part of p110gamma, the latter harboring the catalytic domain. Thus, Gbetagamma may allosterically activate PI3Kgamma through a conformational change in the catalytic domain. Accordingly, Gbetagamma significantly increases Vmax of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, in turn, recruits PH domain-containing effectors such as GRP1 or Btk to the plasma membrane (dotted arrow).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33765</offset><text>In our paper, we present evidence that p110gamma is stable as a monomer without p101, but not vice versa. This may explain why relevant amounts of native monomeric p101 do not occur in vivo (Wetzker, R., personal communication). p110gamma can be expressed as a stable protein independent of the presence of p101, as shown previously (Fig. 2 C; Lopez-Ilasaca et al., 1997, 1998; Leopoldt et al., 1998; Maier et al., 1999). Interestingly, the p110 subunit of class IA PI3Ks needs stabilization by forming a complex with the p85 adaptor (Yu et al., 1998). Accordingly, class IA p110alpha,beta,delta subunits are thought to occur only in their adaptor-bound form. Moreover, the p85 adaptor is more abundant than the p110 counterparts (Ueki et al., 2002). In contrast, p110gamma is also suggested to occur in the absence of p101 (Baier et al., 1999).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34594</offset><text>Increasing evidences suggest that monomeric p110gamma may also function as a downstream regulator of GPCR-dependent signal transduction pathways in cells (Lopez-Ilasaca et al., 1997, 1998; Bondeva et al., 1998; Murga et al., 1998; Baier et al., 1999). However, under in vivo conditions the p101 subunit seems mandatory for G protein-mediated activation of PI3Kgamma by mediating membrane recruitment. Therefore, the question arises of how monomeric p110gamma translocates to the membrane. In this context, recent in vitro evidence points to the possibility that membrane attachment of p110gamma may involve binding to anionic phospholipids (Kirsch et al., 2001). In line with this finding, the majority of PI3Kgamma is already associated with lipid vesicles in the absence of Gbetagamma under in vitro conditions, and vesicle-bound PI3Kgamma can still be activated by Gbetagamma (Krugmann et al., 2002). Alternatively, p110gamma may be recruited by binding to membrane-anchored proteins other than Gbetagamma. In this respect, p110gamma, like all other class I PI3Ks, is directly activated by GTP-bound Ras (Pacold et al., 2000).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35687</offset><text>In conclusion, we present in vivo evidence that Gbetagamma may stimulate PI3Kgamma in a dual and complementary way, i.e., by recruitment to the membrane, and by activation of the membrane-bound enzyme (Fig. 9). In this scenario, the p101 subunit functions as an adaptor molecule necessary to recruit the catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane through high affinity interaction with Gbetagamma. In turn, direct interaction between Gbetagamma and the membrane-attached catalytic p110gamma subunit contributes to a final activation of the enzyme by a mechanism other than translocation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36252</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>36274</offset><text>Construction of expression plasmids</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36310</offset><text>For generation of expression plasmids of PI3Kgamma subunits, restriction sites were introduced, and stop codons were removed by 8-12 cycles of PCR using the indicated primers, a PCR system (Expand HF; Roche), and a pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for first subcloning.
