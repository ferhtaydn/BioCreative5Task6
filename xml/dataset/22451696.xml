In this paper, we report that blocking membrane traffic causes a mitotic checkpoint arrest via Wee1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. Checkpoint signals are relayed by the Rho1 GTPase, protein kinase C (Pkc1), and a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2ACdc55). Signaling via this pathway is dependent on membrane traffic and appears to increase gradually during polar bud growth. We hypothesize that delivery of vesicles to the site of bud growth generates a signal that is proportional to the extent of polarized membrane growth and that the strength of the signal is read by downstream components to determine when sufficient growth has occurred for initiation of mitosis. Growth-dependent signaling could explain how membrane growth is integrated with cell cycle progression. It could also control both cell size and morphogenesis, thereby reconciling divergent models for mitotic checkpoint function.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1247</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1260</offset><text>Eukaryotic cells show extraordinary diversity in size and shape, and they can maintain the same size even as their rate of growth changes. The mechanisms that underlie size control are largely unknown. It seems likely that these mechanisms are as ancient and conserved as the cell cycle because they would have been necessary for survival of the earliest eukaryotic cells. If so, there must be universal mechanisms for cell size control that are robust and adaptable so that they can function in cells of diverse shape and in cells that differ by many orders of magnitude in size. Although several proteins are known to be required for cell size control, it has not yet been possible to identify conserved core mechanisms that control cell size (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2034</offset><text>Cell size checkpoints play an important role in cell size control (Rupes, 2002; Kellogg, 2003; Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004). These checkpoints ensure that key cell cycle transitions are initiated only when sufficient growth has occurred. A cell size checkpoint that operates at entry into mitosis is thought to be mediated by the Wee1 kinase and the Cdc25 phosphatase (Nurse, 1975; Nurse et al., 1976). Wee1 delays mitosis by phosphorylating and inhibiting Cdk1 (Gould and Nurse, 1989). Cdc25 promotes entry into mitosis by removing the inhibitory phosphorylation (Russell and Nurse, 1986; Dunphy and Kumagai, 1991; Gautier et al., 1991; Kumagai and Dunphy, 1991). Early work in fission yeast discovered that Wee1 mutants enter mitosis before sufficient growth has occurred, leading to abnormally small cells (Nurse, 1975). Conversely, Cdc25 mutants delay entry into mitosis and become abnormally large (Nurse, 1975; Russell and Nurse, 1986). These observations led to the hypothesis that Wee1 delays mitosis until cells have reached a critical size.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3083</offset><text>The budding yeast homologues of Wee1 and Cdc25 are called Swe1 and Mih1. Loss of Swe1 causes premature mitosis and a reduced cell size (Lim et al., 1996; Jorgensen et al., 2002; Harvey and Kellogg, 2003; Harvey et al., 2005; Rahal and Amon, 2008). Loss of Mih1 causes delayed mitosis and an increased size (Russell et al., 1989; Jorgensen et al., 2002; Pal et al., 2008). Thus, the key functions of Wee1 and Cdc25 in fission yeast have been conserved in budding yeast, which suggests the existence of a conserved checkpoint. However, a role for Wee1 and Cdc25 family members in cell size control has been controversial because mutants may cause cell size defects indirectly by allowing more or less time for growth before entry into mitosis. Moreover, an alternative model has been proposed in which Wee1 and Cdc25 family members mediate a morphogenesis checkpoint that monitors the shape of the cell via the actin cytoskeleton (Lew and Reed, 1995a; Gachet et al., 2001; Lew, 2003; McNulty and Lew, 2005). The checkpoint functions of Wee1 and Cdc25 are uncertain because we lack a clear understanding of the upstream signals that control their activity. Elucidation of these signals is thus an essential step toward understanding G2/M checkpoints and conserved mechanisms that control entry into mitosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4388</offset><text>Recent work has led to a new understanding of the function and regulation of Wee1 and Cdc25 family members. In both vertebrates and yeast, Wee1 and Cdc25 function in a systems-level mechanism that generates and maintains a low level of Cdk1 activity during early mitosis (Deibler and Kirschner, 2010; Harvey et al., 2011). The underlying mechanism is best understood in yeast. Swe1 is initially phosphorylated by Cdk1 associated with mitotic cyclins, which stimulates Swe1 to bind, phosphorylate, and inhibit Cdk1 (Harvey et al., 2005, 2011). The initial phosphorylation of Swe1 is opposed by protein phosphatase 2A associated with the Cdc55 regulatory subunit (PP2ACdc55; Harvey et al., 2011). The opposing activity of PP2ACdc55 sets a threshold that limits activation of Wee1 by Cdk1, thereby allowing a low level of Cdk1 activity to escape Wee1 inhibition in early mitosis. A key early mitotic event that is initiated via low level activation of Cdk1 is a positive feedback loop in which Cdk1 promotes transcription of the mitotic cyclin Clb2, which leads to a rapid rise in Clb2 levels (Amon et al., 1993; Harvey et al., 2011). A second key event is a switch in the pattern of bud growth. Growth of the bud initially occurs in a polar manner, but when the mitotic cyclins appear, they trigger a switch to isotropic growth, in which growth occurs over the entire surface of the bud (Lew and Reed, 1993). The mitotic cyclins induce this switch by repressing transcription of the G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2, which drive polar bud growth (Lew and Reed, 1993; Amon et al., 1994; McCusker et al., 2007).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5988</offset><text>After the initial phosphorylation of Swe1 in early mitosis, subsequent phosphorylation events lead to full hyperphosphorylation of Swe1, which inactivates Swe1 and is likely necessary for full entry into mitosis (Harvey et al., 2005). In vertebrates and yeast, mitotic Cdk1 is capable of full hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of Wee1 family members when it is present at sufficiently high levels (Tang et al., 1993; Mueller et al., 1995; Harvey et al., 2005). However, multiple kinases are required for full hyperphosphorylation of Wee1 family members in vivo, and their relative contributions are poorly understood (Coleman et al., 1993; Wu and Russell, 1993; Shulewitz et al., 1999; Sreenivasan and Kellogg, 1999; Sakchaisri et al., 2004; Asano et al., 2005).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6755</offset><text>Cdc25 family members are also regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of vertebrate Cdc25 by mitotic Cdk1 stimulates Cdc25 activity in a feedback loop that promotes entry into mitosis (Kumagai and Dunphy, 1992; Izumi and Maller, 1993). A similar feedback loop may also work on Mih1 in budding yeast (Pal et al., 2008). Mih1 is also controlled by casein kinase 1, which is encoded by a pair of redundant genes called YCK1 and YCK2 (Pal et al., 2008). Early in the cell cycle, Mih1 undergoes hyperphosphorylation that is dependent on Yck1/2. During entry into mitosis, Yck1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Mih1 is removed by PP2ACdc55. A pair of redundant regulatory proteins called Zds1 and Zds2 bind to PP2ACdc55 and target it to Mih1 but are not required for the activity of PP2ACdc55 against Swe1 (Wicky et al., 2011). A model that could explain these observations is that hyperphosphorylation of Mih1 early in the cell cycle reflects the action of a checkpoint that keeps Mih1 inactive before mitosis. In this model, dephosphorylation of Mih1 by PP2ACdc55 relieves inhibition of Mih1 to promote mitotic entry. Although it has not yet been possible to assay the activity of differently phosphorylated forms of Mih1, genetic data support the idea that hyperphosphorylation of Mih1 is inhibitory (Pal et al., 2008; Wicky et al., 2011).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8096</offset><text>The dramatic cell cycle-dependent changes in phosphorylation of Mih1 and Swe1 likely reflect the action of upstream checkpoint signals that control their activity, yet the cellular events that send checkpoint signals to Mih1 and Swe1 are poorly understood. Here, we have explored the cellular events that send checkpoint signals to Mih1 and Swe1. A starting point for these analyses was the connection between Yck1/2 and Mih1. We found this connection to be intriguing because Yck1/2 are transported to the site of bud growth on secretory vesicles (Babu et al., 2002). Moreover, inactivation of Yck1/2 causes defects in bud growth and Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation (Robinson et al., 1993; Pal et al., 2008). These observations suggested that control of Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation could be linked to membrane traffic. In principle, mechanisms that link cell cycle progression to membrane traffic must exist to ensure that growth is coordinated with the cell cycle. We therefore set out to test for a connection between membrane traffic and control of Mih1 and Swe1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9170</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9178</offset><text>Blocking membrane traffic triggers a rapid Swe1-dependent checkpoint arrest</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9254</offset><text>We analyzed the effects of disrupting membrane traffic on progression through mitosis in synchronized rapidly dividing cells. To disrupt membrane traffic, we used a temperature-sensitive mutant of SEC6 (sec6-4) because previous work found that it causes a rapid arrest of membrane traffic. Sec6 is a component of the exocyst complex, which is required for docking and fusion of secretory vesicles at the site of membrane growth in the bud (TerBush et al., 1996). To assess mitotic progression, we assayed cleavage of the cohesin Mcd1, which normally occurs at the metaphase to anaphase transition, as well as levels of the mitotic cyclin Clb2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9898</offset><text>Wild-type and sec6-4 cells were released from a G1 arrest and shifted to the restrictive temperature at 30 min after release, which was before bud growth had been initiated. Growth of a new bud was blocked in sec6-4 cells because membrane traffic is required for bud growth. Mcd1 cleavage failed to occur in sec6-4 cells, which indicated that they arrested before anaphase (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether the arrest was caused by Swe1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1, we also assayed Mcd1 cleavage in sec6-4 swe1Delta cells (Fig. 1 A). The extent and timing of Mcd1 cleavage were similar in wild-type and sec6-4 swe1Delta cells, which revealed that swe1Delta caused complete checkpoint failure. As expected, the sec6-4 cells arrested with a single nucleus, whereas the sec6-4 swe1Delta cells underwent nuclear division within the unbudded mother cell to form binucleate cells (Fig. 1 B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>10788</offset><text>Blocking membrane traffic triggers a checkpoint arrest.

The sec6-4 mutant caused a severe delay in Clb2 accumulation that was rescued by swe1Delta (Fig. 1 C). We also analyzed mitotic spindles. In budding yeast, assembly of a short mitotic spindle is initiated in early mitosis by a low level of mitotic Cdk1 activity (Rahal and Amon, 2008). During anaphase, the spindle elongates to segregate the chromosomes. The sec6-4 mutant caused delayed and reduced assembly of short spindles as well as a complete block to spindle elongation (Fig. 1, D and E). Clb2 levels remained elevated, and long spindles did not disassemble normally in sec6-4 swe1Delta cells, which may be caused by a checkpoint that prevents exit from mitosis when cytokinesis is blocked by a checkpoint that monitors spindle orientation in the daughter bud (Balasubramanian et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000). Membrane traffic is required for cytokinesis (Xu et al., 2002).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12679</offset><text>Together, these observations demonstrate that blocking membrane traffic triggers a Swe1-dependent checkpoint arrest.

We therefore tested whether blocking membrane traffic sends signals to Mih1 or Swe1. Mih1 and Swe1 undergo dramatic changes in phosphorylation during entry into mitosis that provide a readout for signals that control their activity or localization (Sreenivasan and Kellogg, 1999; Harvey et al., 2005; Pal et al., 2008). Phosphorylation of Swe1 and Mih1 can be assayed by Western blotting, which detects shifts in their electrophoretic mobility. In principle, changes in phosphorylation of Mih1 or Swe1 during a checkpoint arrest could be a cause of the arrest, or they could be an indirect consequence of the arrest. To test for the latter possibility, we included a control in which phosphorylation of Swe1 and Mih1 was assayed in sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells. The cdk1-Y19F allele lacks the conserved tyrosine that is targeted by Swe1, so cells carrying this allele fail to undergo checkpoint arrest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14127</offset><text>Wild-type, sec6-4, and sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells were released from a G1 arrest and shifted to the restrictive temperature at 30 min after release. The dephosphorylation of Mih1 that normally occurs during entry into mitosis failed to occur normally in sec6-4 cells (Fig. 2 A). Limited dephosphorylation of Mih1 occurred in sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells, but it was delayed and diminished. Swe1 underwent partial hyperphosphorylation in sec6-4 and sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells but failed to undergo the normal full hyperphosphorylation that is associated with inactivation of Swe1 (Fig. 2 B). It also failed to undergo destruction. The partial phosphorylation of Swe1 observed in sec6-4 and sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells likely corresponds to the initial activation of Swe1 by Cdk1 that occurs during entry into mitosis (Harvey et al., 2005, 2011).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>14953</offset><text>Normal signaling to Mih1 and Swe1 fails to occur when membrane traffic is blocked.

Wild-type and sec6-4 cells were released from a G1 arrest and shifted to the restrictive temperature at 70 min after release. At this time, bud emergence was complete, and Mih1 dephosphorylation was just beginning. Because Mih1 dephosphorylation is initiated when the mitotic cyclin Clb2 first appears, the presence of dephosphorylated forms of Mih1 indicated that cells were initiating the G2 to M transition (Pal et al., 2008). Blocking membrane traffic at this point caused rapid reversal of Mih1 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). The response was remarkably rapid: Mih1 hyperphosphorylation was complete within 5 min. The response time includes the time required for the cultures to reach the restrictive temperature and for protein inactivation to occur, so it is likely that the actual response time is even more rapid. Inactivation of sec6-4 at this time did not cause a rapid change in Swe1 phosphorylation, although at the time of the temperature shift, Swe1 was in the partially phosphorylated active form and had not yet undergone full hyperphosphorylation that is associated with Swe1 inactivation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>16965</offset><text>Blocking membrane traffic triggers rapid signaling to Mih1.

This is consistent with the experiment in Fig. 2 A, which showed that dephosphorylated forms of Mih1 appear in later time points in sec6-4 cdk1-Y19F cells shifted to the restrictive temperature in G1. One explanation for these observations is that mitotic Cdk1 activity may trigger a positive feedback loop that contributes to Mih1 dephosphorylation, but only when it reaches high levels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18013</offset><text>To test whether rapid hyperphosphorylation of Mih1 is a general response to an arrest of secretion, we tested a mutant that affects intra-Golgi transport (sec7-4).

This was based on the observation that depolymerization of actin causes a Swe1-dependent checkpoint arrest (Lew and Reed, 1995a; Lew, 2003; Keaton and Lew, 2006). Because actin is required for bud morphogenesis, it was proposed that the checkpoint monitors bud morphogenesis. However, actin is required for delivery of vesicles to the growing bud, and depolymerization of actin therefore causes rapid cessation of growth (Mulholland et al., 1997; Karpova et al., 2000). Thus, depolymerization of actin could activate a checkpoint arrest indirectly by blocking membrane traffic. Conversely, blocking membrane traffic causes defects in actin organization, which suggests that blocking membrane traffic could cause a checkpoint arrest indirectly by causing defects in actin organization (Finger and Novick, 1997; Pruyne et al., 2004).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19491</offset><text>To learn more about the relative effects of depolymerizing actin versus blocking membrane traffic, we tested whether actin depolymerization caused rapid hyperphosphorylation of Mih1.

PP2ACdc55 was a good candidate because it controls both Swe1 and Mih1 (Lin and Arndt, 1995; Minshull et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2000; Pal et al., 2008; Yasutis et al., 2010; Harvey et al., 2011; Wicky et al., 2011). PP2ACdc55 is regulated by a pair of redundant proteins called Zds1 and Zds2 that associate with PP2ACdc55 and target it to Mih1 (Queralt and Uhlmann, 2008; Yasutis et al., 2010; Wicky et al., 2011). It appears that Zds1/2 can play both activating and inhibitory roles in regulation of PP2ACdc55 (Pal et al., 2008; Queralt and Uhlmann, 2008).

We found that overexpression of Zds1 drove cells through the checkpoint arrest caused by blocking membrane traffic, as revealed by cleavage of Mcd1 (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, overexpression of Zds1 in checkpoint-arrested cells caused dephosphorylation of Mih1 and hyperphosphorylation of Swe1 (Fig. 5, B and C). These observations suggest that PP2ACdc55 coordinately regulates Swe1 and Mih1 and that Zds1/2 are key regulators of the checkpoint functions of PP2ACdc55. An attractive model is that Zds1/2 coordinately regulate Swe1 and Mih1 by shifting the activity of PP2ACdc55 away from Swe1 to Mih1.

Moreover, Pkc1 functions in a signaling pathway that blocks ribosome biogenesis when membrane traffic is blocked, which demonstrates that it mediates a response to arrest of membrane traffic (Li et al., 2000; Nanduri and Tartakoff, 2001). Finally, the closest homologue of Pkc1 in vertebrates is PRK2 (PKC-related kinase 2). Depletion of PRK2 by RNAi causes a G2/M block, most likely due to a failure to properly regulate Cdc25 (Roelants et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007).

We therefore isolated a collection of 40 new pkc1 temperature-sensitive alleles to find alleles that cause rapid inactivation of Pkc1 at 34 C, which does not cause heat shock effects.

Five pkc1 mutants caused a significant fraction of cells to become elongated when grown at semirestrictive temperatures. In each case, the elongated cell phenotype was eliminated by swe1Delta, which indicated that it was caused by a failure to control Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation. The strongest phenotype was observed in pkc1-14 cells grown at a semirestrictive temperature of 30 C. The elongated phenotype became severe when cells were grown to high density, which suggests that pkc1-14 compromises functions of Pkc1 that are important when growth is slowed by nutrient limitation (Fig. 6 B). pkc1-14 was recessive to wild-type PKC1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27682</offset><text>We next assayed Mih1 dephosphorylation in pkc1-14 cells.

A previous study identified temperature-sensitive alleles of RHO1 that appear to be defective in activation of Pkc1 (Saka et al., 2001). We assayed Mih1 phosphorylation in one of these alleles (rho1-2) and found that dephosphorylation of Mih1 failed to occur when cells were grown at a semirestrictive temperature (Fig. 8 A). A hyperphosphorylated form of Mih1 appeared in the rho1-2 cells that was not detected in control cells, which is consistent with a role for Rho1 in activation of PP2ACdc55 (Fig. 8 A, arrowhead). Full hyperphosphorylation of Swe1 failed to occur in rho1-2 cells (Fig. 8 B). In addition, rho1-2 caused cells to arrest in mitosis, as revealed by a failure to degrade the mitotic cyclin Clb2 (Fig. 8 C). The arrest was dependent on Swe1. These observations are consistent with a role for Rho1 in signaling to Mih1 and Swe1. However, bud emergence and growth were delayed in rho1-2 cells at the semirestrictive temperature.

Here, we report that blocking membrane traffic causes a Swe1-dependent checkpoint arrest. The arrest is triggered via concerted effects on the regulation of both Swe1 and Mih1. PP2ACdc55 appears to be the agent of concerted checkpoint control. Signals regarding the status of membrane traffic are relayed to PP2ACdc55 via a signaling axis that includes Rho1, Pkc1, and Zds1/2. Fig. 10 A summarizes dependency relationships in the axis defined by loss- and gain-of-function mutants.

The rapidity of the response suggests that the checkpoint monitors membrane traffic events, rather than events that are disrupted as a secondary consequence of a block to membrane traffic. The Rho1-Pkc1 signaling axis suggests further connections to membrane traffic. Rho1 is transported on post-Golgi vesicles in an inactive form and becomes activated at the site of membrane growth (Abe et al., 2003). A mutant that blocks vesicle fusion at the site of growth also blocks Rho1 activation (Abe et al., 2003). In addition, Rom2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor known to activate Rho1, is localized to the site of bud growth independently of membrane traffic (Abe et al., 2003). Active Rho1 directly binds Pkc1 and induces Pkc1 autophosphorylation, and Pkc1 undergoes hyperphosphorylation during the period of bud growth that is dependent on vesicle fusion. Pkc1, in turn, binds to PP2ACdc55-Zds1/2, which directly controls the phosphorylation states of Mih1 and Swe1 (Uetz et al., 2000; Drees et al., 2001; Pal et al., 2008; Yasutis et al., 2010; Wicky et al., 2011).

Indeed, it is likely that the most ancient and conserved function of the secretory pathway is to generate membranes for cell growth. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the checkpoint monitors membrane growth to ensure that cell cycle progression is integrated with membrane growth. The checkpoint could also monitor membrane growth as part of a mechanism that controls cell size. Our observations, combined with previous observations, suggest interesting possibilities for how this could work. The fact that Rho1 is transported on vesicles and becomes activated at the site of membrane growth suggests a mechanism by which a signal could be generated that is dependent on and proportional to membrane growth: as more and more vesicles are delivered to the site of growth, the Rho1 signal could increase in strength (Fig. 10 C). Downstream components could read the signal and flip a switch when it reaches a threshold, thereby triggering cell cycle progression when sufficient growth has occurred. This model suggests that a cell size checkpoint could operate by monitoring the amount of growth that has occurred, rather than the absolute size of the cell.

In previous work, we found that the Swe1-dependent checkpoint specifically monitors the size or growth of the bud, which is consistent with the idea that the checkpoint can monitor growth at a specific site (Harvey and Kellogg, 2003). Growth-dependent signaling could also work in cells that do not increase their size via polar growth. In this case, growth at multiple sites over the surface of the cell could generate a signal that is read by downstream components. Another attractive feature of growth-dependent signaling is that the proposed components are highly conserved and could carry out similar functions in all eukaryotic cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45014</offset><text>Although growth-dependent signaling is an appealing hypothesis, the data are currently consistent with alternative hypotheses.

However, it has also been proposed that Swe1 and Mih1 mediate a checkpoint that monitors bud morphogenesis rather than size (Lew and Reed, 1995a; Lew, 2003; Keaton and Lew, 2006). The discovery that disrupting membrane traffic at the site of bud growth causes a checkpoint arrest suggests a way to reconcile these divergent views. Because localized membrane traffic is required for both cell growth and morphogenesis, the checkpoint could effectively monitor both events.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46547</offset><text>An appealing model is that the checkpoint controls the duration of polar growth by determining when the switch from polar to isotropic growth occurs. Because mitotic Cdk1 induces the switch, the timing of Cdk1 activation determines the timing of the switch. It is likely that the switch is induced early in mitosis by a low level of Cdk1 activity because G1 cyclins, which drive polar growth, begin to decline as soon as the mitotic cyclins appear (Fig. 9 A). Recent work defined a systems-level mechanism that generates and maintains low level Cdk1 activation in early mitosis (Deibler and Kirschner, 2010; Harvey et al., 2011). Interestingly, mathematical modeling suggests that low level activation of Mih1 is required for low level activation of Cdk1 (Harvey et al., 2011). Therefore, an interesting possibility is that hyperphosphorylation of Mih1 early in the cell cycle keeps it inactive. Pkc1-dependent dephosphorylation of Mih1 could then relieve inhibition of Mih1 and allow it to become active at a basal level that promotes low level activation of Cdk1/Clb2, thereby triggering the switch from polar to isotropic growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47680</offset><text>We found no evidence that expression of constitutively active Rho1 or Pkc1 from the GAL1 promoter could trigger destruction of Mcd1 or hyperphosphorylation of Swe1 in checkpoint-arrested cells.

This plasmid can be cut with Nco1 to target integration at URA3. An integrating vector that expresses RHO1 from the GAL1 promoter was created by amplifying the RHO1 open reading frame and cloning into the HindIII and EagI sites of pDK20 to create pDN1 (oligos 5'-GCGCAAGCTTATGTCACAACAAGTTGGTAACAGTATCAGAAGA-3' and 5'-CGCCGGCCGCTATAACAAGACACACTTCTTCTTCTTCTTTTCAGTAGT-3'). This plasmid can be cut with Stu1 to target integration at URA3. To create a plasmid that expresses constitutively active RHO1 (RHO1*) from the GAL1 promoter, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert glutamine 68 to histidine in pDN1 to create pDN3 (oligos 5'-TGGGATACCGCTGGTCACGAAGATTATGATAGA-3' and 5'-TCTATCATAATCTTCGTGACCAGCGGTATCCCA-3'; Delley and Hall, 1999). An integrating plasmid that expresses constitutively active PKC1 (PKC1*) tagged with 3xHA was created by amplifying PKC1* from pGAL1-PKC1* (Delley and Hall, 1999) and cloning into the Eag1 and Xho1 sites of pSH32 to create pDN4A (oligos 5'-GCGCTCGAGATGAGTTTTTCACAATTGGAGCAGAACATTAAAAAAAAGA-3' and 5'-GGAAGTGACGGCCGTAAATCCAAATCATCTGGCATAAAGGAAAATCCTCTAAAC-3'). An integrating plasmid that expresses wild-type PKC1 from the GAL1 promoter was created by mutagenizing PKC1* in pDN4A back to wild type to create pDN5A (oligos 5'-GCAGTTGATGGGTGGACTACATCGTCATGGTGCTATTATCAATAGG-3' and 5'-CCTATTGATAATAGCACCATGACGATGTAGTCCACCCATCAACTGC-3'). To make an antibody that recognizes Pkc1, the N terminus of PKC1 was amplified and recombined into the vector pDONR221 (Gateway; Invitrogen) to create pDK117 (oligos 5'-GAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGTCCATGAGTTTTTCACAATTGGAGCAGAAC-3' and 5'-GTCAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCACGGTTGTTGATTATCCATTATGTCATT-3'). The N terminus was then recombined into pDEST15 to create pDK118, which allows expression as a GST fusion. The GST-Pkc1 fusion was purified and used to immunize a rabbit using standard protocols. The serum was run over a GST column to deplete anti-GST antibodies and was then run over a GST-Pkc1 column to purify anti-Pkc1 antibodies. To test the specificity of the antibody, we probed extracts from wild-type cells and from cells in which Pkc1 was fused to CFP. The Pkc1-CFP fusion was shifted above untagged Pkc1, which revealed that there are no background bands in the vicinity of Pkc1 (Fig. S1). Cells carrying the Pkc1-CFP fusion protein as their sole source of Pkc1 grew slowly at low temperatures and were nearly inviable at 37 C, which indicated that the protein was not fully functional. This could explain why multiple phosphorylation forms of the Pkc1-GFP fusion protein were not observed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>57347</offset><text>Cell cycle time courses</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57371</offset><text>Cells were grown overnight at room temperature to an OD600 of 0.65 and were then arrested in G1 by the addition of alpha-factor to either 0.5 microg/ml (for bar1Delta strains) or 15 microg/ml (for BAR1 strains) for 3 h. Cells were released from the arrest by washing 3x with fresh YPD media at room temperature. For time courses involving a temperature shift, cultures were incubated at room temperature before the shift and were transferred to a shaking water bath to shift the temperature.

To assay nuclear division, 250-microl samples were collected, and the cells were pelleted and fixed by resuspending in 250 microl of 70% ethanol and 30% 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Nuclei were stained with Sytox green, and the presence of multiple nuclei was assayed by microscopy. To assay mitotic spindle assembly, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with antitubulin as previously described (Harvey and Kellogg, 2003).

The tubes were immediately placed into a disrupter (Multibeater-8) and shaken at top speed for 25 s. The tubes were briefly spun at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube and then placed in an ice-water bath for 5 min. 250 microl supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and replaced with 250 microl lysis buffer.

A 10-microl sample of the extract was taken before treatment with antibody and frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis by Western blotting. The tubes were rotated gently end over end at 4 C for 1 h and 45 min and then washed three times batchwise with 400 microl lysis buffer without PMSF. Cdc55-3xHA and associated proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 150 microl elution buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml HA dipeptide) at room temperature. The beads were incubated for 15 min and gently mixed every few minutes to allow for mixing of the beads. The beads were pelleted in a microfuge, and 125 microl of the supernatant was removed, taking care to avoid the antibody-containing beads. This process was repeated once more with the exception that 150 microl of the supernatant was removed. The supernatants were pooled and precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 25 microl protein sample buffer; 20 and 2 microl were loaded onto a 9% polyacrylamide gel and used for a Western blot probing for Pkc1 and Cdc55-3xHA, respectively. For Western blotting of the crude extracts, 90 microl protein sample buffer was added to 10 microl of crude extract, the samples were boiled, and 15 microl was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>63620</offset><text>Generation of temperature-sensitive alleles of PKC1</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>63672</offset><text>To generate a collection of PKC1 temperature-sensitive alleles, we first used a PCR-based approach to integrate the His3MX6 marker cassette downstream of the PKC1 gene in the wild-type strain DK186, creating strain DK1631 (oligos 5'-GCCGTATGTTCAACAATGCGCATTCTGTTTACATTATTAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3' and 5'-CTGTCAACTTTAGAAATATGTTAGTAGTAATATAATCCTGAGCGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAC-3').

The PCR product was gel purified and used as a template to carry out a large-scale PCR reaction with the error-prone Taq polymerase (oligos 5'-GATAGCCGTCGAAGAAAATA-3' and 5'-GATTCGTCCATTTATGCCGTAT-3'). The PCR reaction was then transformed into DK186 and plated onto -His plates at ~150 colonies per plate to screen ~4,500 colonies for temperature sensitivity by replica plating. To eliminate mutants in the HIS gene, candidates were also tested for temperature sensitivity on YPD plates, and mutants were further tested for rescue by wild-type PKC1 on a centromere plasmid. The screen identified 36 temperature-sensitive alleles of PKC1. To screen the collection for defects in cell growth, mutants were struck on YPD plates and left to grow at room temperature, 34, or 37 C for 2 d.
