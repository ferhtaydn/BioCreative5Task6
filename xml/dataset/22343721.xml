We report the crystal structure of the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 segment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TREX-2 that interfaces with the gene expression machinery. Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 forms a novel PCI-domain complex characterized by the juxtaposition of Sac3 and Thp1 winged helix domains, forming a platform that mediates nucleic acid binding. Structure-guided mutations underline the essential requirement of the Thp1-Sac3 interaction for mRNA binding and for the coupling of transcription and processing with mRNP assembly and export. These results provide insight into how newly synthesized transcripts are efficiently transferred from TREX-2 to the principal mRNA export factor and, identify how Sem1 stabilizes PCI domain-containing proteins and promotes complex assembly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1131</offset><text>Eukaryotic gene expression requires coordination of a series of nuclear events, including transcription and pre-mRNA processing, that culminate in the export of mature mRNA through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) after which translation can begin1-3. Although a host of proteins act in concert to co-transcriptionally package the mRNA transcript into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNP) prior to export 2, the TREX and TREX-2 TRanscription and EXport complexes play a central role by coupling transcription and processing, with mRNA export4. The TREX complex is formed by the association of Yra1 and the DEAD-box helicase Sub2 with the THO complex, and contributes to recruiting and loading of the principal yeast mRNA transport factor (Mex67-Mtr2, metazoan NXF1-NXT1; also known as Tap-p15) onto pre-mRNA1,5-9. The TREX-2 complex facilitates the association of a number of actively-transcribing genes, such as GAL, with NPCs in a process termed &quot;gene gating&quot;10-13 and also contributes to transcriptional memory and genomic stability14-20. Saccharomyces cerevisiae TREX-2 consists of Sac3, Thp1, Sus1 and Cdc31, together with a newly-identified co-factor, Sem1, a small negatively charged protein that may either associate with TREX-2 or influence its stability13,21-24. Although the precise role of Sem1 in TREX-2 is unknown, Sem1 and its human homologue, DSS1, associate with a wide range of conserved complexes including the 19S proteosome lid, and the CSN, eIF3, BRCA2, and Integrator complexes25.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2648</offset><text>During gene gating, TREX-2 mediates the relocation of active genes to the pores through binding to both the nuclear face of NPCs and the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex12. The resultant generation of transcripts in the immediate vicinity of NPCs facilitates export by increasing the entry efficiency of mRNPs into the NPC transport channel26. TREX-2 also participates in the post-transcriptional NPC-gene tethering that can give rise to the transcriptional memory seen with several yeast genes14-17, although interactions between Mlp1 and Mex67 and/or Nab2, and between histone Htz1 and several nucleoporins, may also contribute to this function18. Importantly, deletion of TREX-2 components results in significant growth impairment and widespread mRNA export defects13,21-24, together with defects in transcriptional elongation and RNA-DNA hybridization, which results in the formation of R-loops that generate transcriptional impairment and genetic instability19,20.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3631</offset><text>TREX-2 is based on a Sac3 scaffold to which Thp1, Sus1, and Cdc31 are bound13,21,22. Sus1 and Cdc31 bind to the &quot;CID&quot; domain within the C-terminal portion of Sac3 and are required for the association of TREX-2 with NPCs21,22. The Sac3 CID domain forms a long, gently undulating alpha-helix around which one Cdc31 and two Sus1 chains are wrapped22. In vivo studies using engineered mutations that selectively disrupt the binding of individual chains of Sus1 and Cdc31 to Sac3, indicate that Sus1 and Cdc31 function synergistically to promote the NPC-TREX-2 association22. However, it is unclear how NPC-bound TREX-2 associates with other components of the gene expression machinery to integrate mRNA processing with nuclear export or influence transcriptional memory and genomic stability. The N-terminal region of Sac3 (residues 1-572) is critical for this function and binds both Thp1 and the major mRNA transport factor Mex67-Mtr2. Deletion of either this Sac3 region or Thp1 causes mRNA export and growth defects in yeast21,23. It also remains unclear whether Sem1 binds directly to TREX-2 and, if it does so, to which components it binds and with what stoichiometry23,24. The functions of TREX-2 in mRNA export are conserved from yeast to humans, with the human Sac3 homologue, GANP, linking the nuclear export of specific mRNPs with transcription and processing27.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5004</offset><text>We report here the 2.9 A resolution crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Sac3 residues 253-551 complexed with Thp1 and Sem1, together with the 2.1 A resolution structure of the homologous human PCID2-DSS1 complex, and use structure-guided mutagenesis to define how this region of TREX-2 contributes to mRNA export in vivo. Sac3 and Thp1(PCID2) have PCI folds based on an N-terminal superhelical domain formed by a stack of alpha-helices, and capped by a C-terminal alpha/beta winged helix domain. Sem1(DSS1) binds primarily to Thp1(PCID2), where it appears to have a stabilizing role. Unexpectedly, the complex is intricately arranged so that the juxtaposition of winged helix domains on Sac3 and Thp1 forms an architectural platform that is critical for nucleic acid binding. A series of engineered Sac3 and Thp1 variants containing structure-guided mutations delineate the essential contributions made by both the Thp1-Sac3 interaction and subsequent nucleic acid binding to the coupling of mRNA export to transcription and pre-mRNA processing. These results provide insight into how newly synthesized transcripts are efficiently transferred from TREX-2 to the principal mRNA export factor, and also indicate how Sem1 can actively stabilize PCI domain-containing proteins and promote complex assembly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6304</offset><text>RESULTS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6312</offset><text>Sem1 stabilizes Thp1 and promotes interaction with Sac3</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6368</offset><text>Pull-down assays were used to monitor assembly of the TREX-2 complex and interactions between bacterially-expressed Sac3, Thp1, and Sem1 (Fig. 1a).

The solubility of Sac3 was not influenced by Sem1 coexpression, indicating that Thp1, but not Sac3, required Sem1 association for its solubility (Fig. 1a, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, Sem1 was not pulled down by Sac3 unless Thp1 was present (Fig. 1a, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that Sem1 stabilizes Thp1 and in turn facilitates formation of a stoichiometric Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex in vitro.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7119</offset><text>Crystal structure of the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7171</offset><text>Crystals obtained using vapor diffusion of Sac3 residues 250-563 (Sac3-M) bound to full-length Thp1 and Sem1 diffracted to 2.9 A resolution using synchrotron radiation (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contained two copies of the complex and had a high solvent content of ~70 %. The final model generated by Se-Met SIR phasing followed by iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding contained Sac3 residues 253-551, Thp1 residues 2-159 and 164-455, and Sem1 residues 23-41 and 53-89. Density for the remaining residues was absent from the final map (Fig. 1b,c).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7733</offset><text>Figure 1c and Supplementary Movie 1 illustrate the structure of the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex. Thp1 and Sac3 have PCI folds25 and are each based on an N-terminal right-handed superhelical domain capped by a C-terminal winged helix domain analogous to that observed in the eIF3k subunit of the eIF3 complex and the Csn7 component of the CSN complex28,29. A single Sem1 chain wraps intimately around Thp1, but makes little contact with Sac3, demonstrating that Sem1 is a stoichiometric component of the TREX-2 complex. The Thp1 superhelical domain forms a right-handed superhelix of 15 alpha-helices that is capped by a winged helix domain formed by helices alpha16-18 and beta-strands 1-3 (Fig. 1d), Sac3-M has a comparable PCI fold with a right-handed superhelical domain formed by helices alpha1-9 and a winged helix domain formed by helices alpha10-12 and beta-strands 1-3 (Fig. 1e,f and Supplementary Discussion). A striking feature of the complex is the spatial orientation of the winged helix domains. In both Thp1 and Sac3 these winged helix domains each have an alphabetaalphaalphabetabeta motif and associate to form a 6-stranded beta-sheet at the surface of the complex (Fig. 1f). This arrangement generates a prominent winged helix dimer that, together with interactions between helices within the superhelical domains of Sac3 and Thp1, constitutes the extensive interaction interface between the two proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9122</offset><text>Sem1 binds primarily to Thp1</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9151</offset><text>Sem1 makes extensive contacts with Thp1, burying 2741 A2 of surface area, but makes only minor contact to Sac3, burying 293 A2 (Supplementary Movie 2). Sem1 residues 53-89 make extensive interactions across the surface of the Thp1 superhelical domain and form a strongly conserved C-terminal helix (Supplementary Fig. 1) that binds in the cleft formed between helices alpha16 and alpha17 of the winged helix domain (Fig. 2a,b). The conserved Sem1 Trp60 and Trp64 are buried in surface pockets formed between residues on Thp1 helices alpha11, alpha12, and alpha16, whereas conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe73, Leu77, Leu81) lock the Sem1 helix into the hydrophobic cleft of the winged helix domain (Fig. 2b). The Sem1 helix and Trp60 have excellent density (Supplementary Fig. 2a) and low B-factors, suggesting that they provide the Sem1 binding register, whereas the negative charges of the aspartic and glutamic acids strengthen the interaction by forming ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the positively charged surface of Thp1. This intimate burial of the Sem1 C-terminus is consistent with C-terminally tagged Sem1 losing both its ability to bind Thp1 in yeast and its mRNA export function24. Sem1 residues 23-41 bind in a positively charged cleft formed by the TPR-like helices of the Thp1 superhelical domain (Fig. 2c,d). In this cleft, aspartates and glutamates from Sem1 form extensive ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds with several Thp1 helices (Fig 2c). Furthermore, the ring of conserved Sem1 Phe35 is buried. This region of Sem1 also makes limited contact with Sac3 helices alpha4 and alpha6, but these Sem1 residues are poorly conserved and probably contribute little to the overall binding. No electron density was observed for the poorly-conserved residues (1-22) at the Sem1 N-terminus, and between the N and C-terminal binding sites (residues 42-52).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11015</offset><text>PCID2-DSS1 retains key structural features of Thp1-Sem1</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11075</offset><text>The 2.1 A resolution crystal structure of the human Thp1 homologue, PCID2 (residues 205-399) complexed with DSS1 (residues 38-67) was also determined (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Although not present in the crystal structure, the region homologous to Sac3 (250-563) in its human homologue GANP (residues 686-981, Supplementary Fig. 1b), retained binding affinity for the PCID2DSS1 complex (Supplementary Fig. 3). As observed for Thp1, coexpression with DSS1 was necessary to obtain soluble PCID2, consistent with a conserved stabilizing function of Sem1(DSS1) in these complexes (Supplementary Fig. 3). PCID2 retained the same pattern of helices followed by a C-terminal winged helix domain observed in Thp1, and the DSS1 C-terminal helix bound to PCID2 mimicking the binding of Sem1 to Thp1 (Fig. 2e,f, Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Movie 3). The corresponding regions of the two structures are highly homologous and show a strong conservation of the interaction interface between Thp1-Sem1 and PCID2-DSS1 (Supplementary Discussion). Furthermore, this structural homology indicates that the Thp1-Sem1 structure is most likely not altered substantially when it binds to Sac3 (Fig. 2f).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>12271</offset><text>Structural basis for the recruitment of Thp1-Sem1 to Sac3</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12331</offset><text>Our structural data indicate that recruitment of Thp1-Sem1 to Sac3 is mediated primarily by the interface formed between the Sac3 and Thp1 winged helix domains, with Sem1 making a marginal contribution. The Thp1-Sac3 interface is extensive, with a buried surface area of 2318 A2. Thp1 helices alpha16, alpha17, alpha18 and the alpha17-alpha18 loop form the major interaction interface with Sac3 (Fig. 3a). These residues are predominantly within the Thp1 winged helix domain, with helix alpha18 appearing crucial to the interaction with numerous conserved residues interacting with Sac3 (Fig. 3b). This helix binds to a cleft formed by helix alpha9 of the Sac3 superhelical domain and alpha10 of the winged helix domain. Helices alpha6, alpha7 and alpha8 of the Sac3 HD domain also make significant interactions at the base of the interface with Thp1 helices alpha15 and alpha16 (Fig. 3c).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13187</offset><text>The extensive interface between Thp1 and Sac3 frustrated engineering of single point mutations in either protein that alone could impair their interaction significantly (data not shown). However, a number of double point mutants in Sac3 and Thp1 were constructed that reduced the affinity of Thp1 for Sac3250-563 in vitro. Thus, Sac3250-563-F391A F425D that removed the buried hydrophobic Phe425 within the hydrophobic pocket formed by Thp1 alpha16, alpha18 and the alpha17-alpha18 loop, together with Phe391 that was buried at the base of the interface (Fig. 3b,c), showed reduced Thp1 binding (Fig. 3d). A second strategy targeted the interactions of Thp1 helix alpha18, which binds in the cleft formed by helices alpha9 and alpha10 of the Sac3 winged helix domain (Fig. 3b). The addition of two bulky side chains (V405Y T406W) to this helix obstructed the intimate association of the binding surfaces and reduced binding to Sac3250-563 (Fig. 3d), while retaining Sem1 binding, indicating that the structure of Thp1 was not altered significantly (Fig. 3e) by the mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14242</offset><text>Ablating Sac3-Thp1 binding inhibits growth and mRNA export</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14303</offset><text>In yeast, single sac3 or thp1 gene disruptions or a double sac3-thp1 knock-out are not lethal, but cause a slower growth phenotype, especially at higher (e.g. 37 C) and lower temperatures (e.g. 23 C), albeit the strength of these growth defects at different temperatures can vary depending on the strain background13,21,22. The in vivo consequences of disrupting the Sac3-Thp1 interaction were tested by expressing the sac3 and thp1 single, and sac3-thp1 double mutant constructs under their own promoter and from single copy plasmids in the corresponding sac3Delta, thp1Delta or sac3Delta-thp1Delta null strains. Epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant thp1 alleles, modified at the 3'-end of the gene with the FLAG-TEV-ProtA construct (THP1-FLAGPA or thp1-FLAGPA) were used, which allowed tandem affinity-purification of TREX-2 from wild-type and mutant cells and analysis of potential defects in TREX-2 assembly and/or stability. Individual sac3 or thp1 mutations that reduced the binding of Thp1-Sem1 to Sac3250-563 in vitro did not impair the interaction with full-length Sac3 in vivo sufficiently to cause a significant growth defect, albeit there was a small increase in the number of cells showing nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ mRNA (Fig. 3f). However, the combination of these sac3 and thp1 alleles (sac3-F391A F425D; thp1-V405Y T406W) impaired cell growth at 23 C and caused mRNA export defects equivalent to the sac3Deltathp1Delta double disruption mutant (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, when Thp1-FLAGPA was affinity-purified from this quadruple mutant, the Thp1-V405Y T406W mutant protein could be obtained in significant amounts, but the other TREX-2 subunits Sac3-F391A F425D, Cdc31, Sus1 and Sem1 did not co-enrich (Fig. 3h). These data indicate that TREX-2 assembly is effectively eliminated in vivo in the quadruple sac3-thp1 mutant and highlight the essential contribution made by the binding of Thp1-Sem1 to Sac3 to the function of TREX-2 in mRNA export.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16260</offset><text>Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 forms a platform that binds nucleic acids</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16321</offset><text>Winged helix domains are common nucleic acid binding motifs that interact with dsDNA, ssDNA and RNA30 and previous work has indicated that Thp1 may bind nucleic acids in vitro31.

Whereas the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex bound polyA25 RNA to generate a slowly migrating complex at the top of the gel, its individual components (Thp1-Sem1 and ProteinA-tagged-Sac3250-563) did not associate efficiently with RNA (Fig. 4a,b). Nucleic acid binding could be reconstituted by incubating the individual components prior to the addition of RNA, indicating they were functional and the ProteinA-tag of Sac3250-563 did not interfere with RNA binding (Fig. 4b).

The Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex had comparable affinity for both ssDNA and RNA and also associated with dsDNA with a similar affinity to a ssDNA fragment of the same sequence (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). The Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex had a higher affinity for polyU RNA than other bases, suggesting a level of specificity in the binding to RNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17976</offset><text>In the complex, the juxtaposition of the Sac3 and Thp1 winged helix domains generates a positively charged stripe that runs from the junction between the two winged helix domains and down the surface of Sac3 and Thp1 (Fig. 4g). Within this positively charged stripe, Thp1 contains three highly conserved basic residues (Arg414, Lys427, Lys428) that are solvent exposed and do not appear to have a critical structural role (red spheres in Fig. 4h). Arg414 is positioned between helix alpha18 and the outer beta2 strand of the Thp1 winged helix domain and is strongly conserved (Fig. 4h-i). Lysines 427 and 428 are solvent exposed on the second wing of the winged helix domain between the central beta3 strand and helix alpha19, and are also strongly conserved (Fig. 4h-i). Sac3 also contains basic residues within this stripe including Lys467 and Lys468, positioned between the first helix alpha10 and beta1 strand of the Sac3 winged helix domain, and Lys509. Although less obviously conserved, these residues are solvent exposed within the junction between the winged helix domains (green spheres in Fig. 4h). Variants were engineered in which these basic residues were mutated to aspartic acid. Thp1-R414D, and the double mutant K427D K428D, dramatically reduced the affinity of the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex for nucleic acids (Fig. 4j-k). Similar impairment was seen with Sac3-K509D and the K467D K468D double mutant (Fig. 4j-k), indicating that these residues contribute to a novel nucleic acid binding surface generated by the juxtaposition of the Sac3 and Thp1 winged helix domains in the complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>19565</offset><text>Impaired RNA binding generates growth and export defects</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19622</offset><text>sac3 and thp1 mutants that impair DNA or RNA binding in vitro caused significant growth and mRNA export defects in vivo, similar to those observed with the combination of sac3 and thp1 alleles that interfered with the Sac3-Thp1 interaction in vivo (Fig. 5).

Although Sac3250-563-K509D impaired RNA binding in vitro (Fig. 4j,k), this was not sufficiently severe to generate a growth defect in vivo and showed only a small export defect (Fig. 5d,e). However, this allele was synthetically lethal with yra1-DeltaRRM, but not with mex67-5 (Fig. 5f). These data suggests that in vivo the milder RNA binding defect exerted by the sac3-K509D allele is linked to the function of Yra1 in the export pathway.

TREX-2 comprises two subregions that make different contributions to its function. Whereas the localization of TREX-2 to NPCs requires its proximal CID domain complexed with Cdc31 and two Sus1 chains13,22, its interaction with the transcription and mRNP assembly machinery is mediated by its distal N- and M-regions21 that bind Thp1-Sem1 and Mex67-Mtr2. Deletion of thp1 or sem1 results in mRNA export defects and generation of mRNPs with elevated Yra1 and Sub2 levels23. These observations, together with the synthetic growth defects observed between TREX-2 mutants with impaired nucleic acid binding and the mex67-5 or yra1-DeltaRRM alleles (Fig. 5f), are consistent with the distal region of TREX-2 functioning to load Mex67-Mtr2 and generate export-competent mRNPs23. Mex67-Mtr2 by itself has low affinity for mRNA and its recruitment to mRNPs and generation of export-competent complexes requires Yra1 (refs 1,3). Mex67-Mtr2 binds to the Sac3 N-terminus adjacent to Thp1-Sem1 probably through its NTF2-like and UBA domains binding to Sac3 FG-nup-like repeats21. As illustrated in Figure 6, tethering an mRNA transcript already loaded with Yra1 and Sub2 to the winged helix domains of Sac3 and Thp1 would bring it in close proximity to the Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimer, promoting the generation of an export-competent mRNP in the immediate vicinity of the pore, thereby increasing the rate of mRNA export.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23833</offset><text>TREX-2 plays a critical role in the redistribution of actively transcribed genes in gene gating, through its interactions with both SAGA and NPCs12.

Although we have not explored this possibility in vivo, because TREX-2 also associates with dsDNA in vitro, the complex could also associate with DNA exposed in actively-transcribing genes, thereby facilitating their association with NPCs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>24589</offset><text>Sem1 function and implications for other PCI-complexes</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24644</offset><text>Although Sem1 has been proposed to function as the &quot;molecular glue&quot; that holds Sac3 and Thp1 together32, in TREX-2 Sem1 makes few contacts with Sac3 and instead appears to facilitate complex formation by stabilizing Thp1. A stabilizing role for Sem1 would be consistent with studies in sem1Delta strains that showed reduced TREX-2 Thp1 levels24. Sem1 may also stabilize other complexes. Within the 19S proteosome lid33, Sem1 associates with the PCI-proteins Rpn7 and Rpn3 to form a subcomplex with Rpn12. Significantly, Sem1 deletion results in destabilization of the 19S proteosome34,35. Sem1 may stabilize Rpn7 or Rpn3 in a manner analogous to the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex, facilitating binding through winged helix juxtaposition. Indeed, deletion of the central acidic motif of Sem1 that associates with the Thp1 TPR-like domain, precludes association of Rpn3 with the proteosome36. Sem1 binds to Thp1 by a mechanism similar to the binding of Hsp70 and Hsp90 to Hop, with the repeating negatively-charged and hydrophobic residues binding in an extended conformation to the positively charged concave binding surface formed by the Thp1 TPR-like repeats37. This binding mechanism is likely to be conserved in the other PCI-domain complexes that interact with Sem1, which could help identify putative binding sites in the PCI domains of the 19S proteosome lid and the eIF3 and CSN complexes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26039</offset><text>The interaction between the Thp1 and Sac3 winged helix domains dominates the interface between these two chains.

In addition to its architectural role in complex formation, this winged helix alignment may create a functional interaction platform analogous to that seen in the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex. Thus, Csn12 and Thp3 also form a stable complex with Sem1 that functions in RNA splicing and transcription elongation through recruitment to transcribed chromatin23,39. Although further work is required to verify the extent to which functional similarity is shared, the homology between Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 and Csn12-Thp3-Sem1 indicates that these complexes may share a nucleic acid binding function mediated by close apposition of their winged helix domains.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27098</offset><text>In summary, the structure of Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 provides a structural basis for understanding how the TREX-2 complex facilitates the formation of export-competent mRNPs at the nuclear face of NPCs and thereby provides a &quot;fast track&quot; for the nuclear export of a subset of transcripts such as those from the GAL system. The close juxtaposition of the winged helix domains of Sac3 and Thp1 is critical for binding mRNA and thereby bringing it in close apposition to the Mex67-Mtr2 export factor. This, in turn, facilitates a remodeling of the RNP that displaces Yra1 while attaching Mex67-Mtr2 more strongly. The small Sem1 protein functions to stabilize Thp1 and probably functions in an analogous way in other complexes that contain PCI folds.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27849</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27872</offset><text>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>27893</offset><text>A.M.E. and M.S. determined structures and performed in vitro experiments whereas L.D. and E.H. performed in vivo studies.

The proximal region of Sac3 to which Sus1 and Cdc31 are attached binds to components of the nuclear basket such as Nup1 whereas the distal region that contains the winged helix domains of Sac3 and Thp1 binds to mRNA, to which Yra1-Sub2 is also attached. The Mex67-Mtr2 nuclear export factor binds to the FG repeats in the distal region of Sac3, probably via its NTF2 and UBA domains that bind to FG-nucleoporins. This interaction brings the Mex67 LRR and RNP domains close to the mRNA, facilitating the Sub2-mediated remodeling that generates an export-competent mRNP close to the NPC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table_title_caption</infon><offset>47166</offset><text>Crystallographic data</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table</infon><offset>47188</offset><text>    Sac3 (250-563)-Thp1-Sem1  PCID2 (201-399)-DSS1        native Se peak native Se peak Se inflection Se remote   Data collection        Space group P4122  P3121   Cell dimensions         a, b, c (A) 164.77, 164.77, 276.79 166.72, 166.72, 284.65 70.52, 70.52, 95.42  70, 70, 95    alpha, beta, gamma ( ) 90, 90, 90 90, 90, 90 90, 90, 120  90, 90, 120   Wavelength (A) 0.9795 0.9803 1.54179 0.9803 0.9805 0.9689  Resolution (A) 20-2.9 (3.06-2.9)* 30-4.2 (4.43-4.2) 30-2.12 (2.23-2.12) 60.98-3.4 (3.58-3.4) 60.8-3.4 (3.58-3.4) 60.65-3.4 (3.58-3.4)   R pim  6.7 (42.8) 4.8 (23.5) 3.1 (36.4) 8.6 (18.6) 8.6 (21.8) 8.1 (19.2)  I / sigmaI 7.4 (1.9) 12.5 (3.5) 14.1 (2.3) 8.0 (4.2) 8.3 (3.8) 8.8 (4.4)  Completeness (%) 99.7 (100) 99.7 (100) 91.0 (94.6) 86.4 (69.8) 86.5 (70.3) 87.0 (71.3)  Redundancy 7.0 (7.0) 14.1 (14.6) 7.3 (5.6) 9.8 (10.5) 10 (10.4) 9.9 (10.4)  No. reflections 591,489 (85,034) 422,691 (63,007) 106,955 (12,010) 34,358 (4,212) 34,866 (4,128) 34,730 (4,284)  Refinement        Resolution (A) 20-2.9  30-2.12     Rwork / Rfree 20.8 / 23.1  20.5 / 23.1     No. atoms         Protein 26387  3753      Water -  33     B-factors         Protein 49.4  46.8      Water -  45.6     r.m.s deviations         Bond lengths (A) 0.011  0.003      Bond angles ( ) 0.91  0.65   </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">table_footnote</infon><offset>48486</offset><text>Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.</text></passage></document></collection>
